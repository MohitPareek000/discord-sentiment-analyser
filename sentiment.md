- Frustration markers: multiple question marks (??), "what is the update??", ALL CAPS complaints

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
The bot also analyzes message context beyond pattern matching:
- Word combinations and proximity (e.g., "problem" near "frustrated")
- Negative intensifiers (e.g., "very bad", "extremely disappointed", "bahut kharab")
- Contextual negations (e.g., "not good", "no help", "nahi achha")
- Problem + help-seeking combinations (e.g., "issue please help")
- Repeated negative themes (same negative word multiple times)
- Multiple questions indicating confusion or frustration (?? ...)
- Urgent language with problems (e.g., "urgent help needed")
- Communication failure patterns (e.g., "still waiting", "no response")
- Time-related frustration (e.g., "days no reply", "kab tak")
- Consequence statements (e.g., "affecting career", "wasting money")

DO NOT flag if it's ONLY:
- Coding help or conceptual doubts about course material
- Simple scheduling questions without complaint
- Positive feedback or casual conversation
- Students helping each other with exercises

Flag immediately if message indicates systemic issues, service failures, or student distress requiring intervention.
