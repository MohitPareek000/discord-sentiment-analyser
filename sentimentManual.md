Hello is there any one from scalar support please help to get fixed my issue related to raiseing help request @918105882539
Same has been happening with me atleast for the last 2 classes . Which was string and arrays. I tried reaching shreemand .. haven’t received a text back.
"Hi Nipun,
Thank you for highlighting 
I am unable to follow your session as at times you are driving the class very fast and skipping the steps when explaining the code
Due to that we get stuck in the class session and we are unable to develop that logic which will be required for assignment 
I have been trying to reach my POC Shreemand from last friday but he is not answerable 
There is lot of concerns that as a fresher we are facing as we have joined the scaler to learn from 0 level

Seeking help from @anshuman for better guidance 
Thank you"
"This is the right platform where we are raising our concern and everyone is present here 
It would be better if we can address this issue here itself
This will give clarity to everyone present in this batch 
We are paying good amount of money to learn this technology and it is not good to redirect to other platforms"
Neither we are receiving good communication from TA for help in understanding the issue
I have tried reaching multiple people from scaler as you can see
2 questions were out of syllabus when i took yesterday
I still want to refund
I am not getting any call back
"Dear Scaler Team,

I kindly request that all future program details be clearly structured and communicated in advance. This will help avoid the need for constant adjustments or expressions of undue gratitude from either side.

At the time of enrollment, we made our decision based on the curriculum and offerings that were initially presented. However, it appears that certain aspects of the program have changed without prior notice, which is concerning.

I encourage your team to take a moment to reassess and define the program structure clearly moving forward, so there is no ambiguity or misalignment of expectations.

Please note that, from a legal standpoint, such changes without prior communication may not be acceptable. I joined this course based on a specific vision and structure that was originally shown. If the program continues to shift after each module or course, it can feel as though we are being compelled to accept terms we did not initially agree to.

So far, things have been manageable, but if the situation worsens, I may be compelled to consider further action to address the issue appropriately.

Looking forward to your cooperation and a resolution."
"Dear Scaler Team,

_Since your team didn't reply to a PM (personal message), I'm compelled to write the same msg in the group. (Do the introspection in your review meetings for this).._

"I won't reach out to anyone.
They reached out to me when they needed a client/customer/student/etc.

You do the thinking now, who should reach out to whom.
I'm not reaching out to anyone for that matter..

My EMI is due day after, I'm holding that for now ."
Do you want me to reply to this "as per law" or if you are actually serious, I would have got a call by now..
@918105882539, as part of new curriculum regular expressions, file handling, exception handling was not covered as part of our python module
"Hello @919996203771 I messaged you personally and am still waiting for a response. I continue to receive daily class notifications, but I cannot attend the evening sessions. This is directly impacting my career and learning progression with Scalar.
As I’ve mentioned before, I can only attend morning or weekend daytime batches. Shifting the batch from morning to evening without taking a poll or student feedback has created a major blocker for me.
I kindly request you to move me to a morning batch or a weekend daytime batch, which I am fully committed to attending. If that is not possible, I am prepared to take a break and wait until Deepak Sharma’s next class begins in morning, as that will allow me to continue in the right timings.I want you to look into this issue on a priority basis. If you cannot address this, or if you are not the right person to help me, I will need to escalate this matter to senior Scalar management. In that case, please share an alternate contact who can resolve my concerns quickly.Evening classes are not an option for me, and I hope you understand the seriousness of how this affects my learning journey and career growth."

Feels like we are moving in reverse direction, advanced to basics.

At this pace can we expect to cover


See all
For an experienced professional, the first three months of an AI/ML syllabus should focus on solidifying advanced foundations, mastering key frameworks, and tackling complex data challenges [1.1, 1.3, 1.5]. This stage is about moving beyond basic concepts to building practical, specialized skills. 
Month 1: Deepen mathematical and programming fundamentals
Mathematics for ML: Revisit the core mathematical concepts with an emphasis on their application in advanced ML [1.1].
Linear algebra: Focus on eigenvectors, singular value decomposition (SVD), and matrix decomposition, understanding how they are used in algorithms like PCA and neural network operations [1.1].
Calculus: Solidify your grasp of multivariable calculus, including gradients, Hessians, and the chain rule as applied to backpropagation in deep learning [1.1].
Probability and statistics: Study Bayesian inference, advanced statistical modeling, and the theory behind different probability distributions relevant to modeling complex data [1.1].
Python for data science: Ensure high proficiency in the standard Python data science ecosystem [1.5].
NumPy and pandas: Master advanced features for efficient data manipulation and numerical computing [1.5].
Data visualization: Become proficient with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating clear and insightful visualizations of complex data [1.5]. 
Month 2: Master frameworks and advanced data processing
Deep learning framework mastery: Become highly proficient in either PyTorch or TensorFlow, as these are the industry standards for deep learning [1.5].
PyTorch vs. TensorFlow: For experienced professionals, the choice often depends on the specific job market or personal preference. PyTorch is often favored in research for its flexibility, while TensorFlow (especially with its TFX platform) is designed for large-scale production deployment.
Framework libraries: Explore and use associated libraries like TorchVision (for computer vision in PyTorch) or the Keras API (for easier model building on TensorFlow).
Advanced data processing and feature engineering: Learn to handle real-world, complex datasets that are often noisy or unstructured [1.3].
Data cleaning and preprocessing: Focus on techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and imbalanced datasets in sophisticated ways.
Feature engineering: Explore creating new features from raw data to improve model performance, especially for time series and text data [1.3].
Data loaders and pipelines: Understand how to build efficient data pipelines using framework-specific tools to prepare data for training large models [1.3]. 
Month 3: Advanced classical ML and project application
Advanced classical algorithms: Revisit and apply core ML algorithms with a focus on optimization and selection [1.2, 1.3].
Ensemble methods: Deepen your understanding and application of advanced boosting algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost [1.3].
Model selection and tuning: Master techniques for cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning using tools like GridSearch and Optuna, and understanding bias-variance tradeoffs in complex models [1.2, 1.3].
Practical project: Apply the knowledge from the first two months to a real-world, end-to-end project.
Project scope: Choose a project that involves advanced data preprocessing and requires you to select, train, and evaluate a classical ML model. This could be a complex regression problem, a multi-class classification task, or a predictive model on a non-standard dataset [1.3].
Focus on process: Emphasize the entire workflow, from data ingestion and cleaning to feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, preparing you for the MLOps stage later in the year [1.3, 1.2]."
"@919970095310 while I understand your concern, the curriculum is something that has been designed by Scaler team and they have been following the same for all batches. 

I as an individual instructor dont alone have a say in the curriculum. I alone cannot decide what to cover and what not to. It is something pre-decided that tends to every person in the batch, that I have to follow with maybe a little amount of freedom.

However, I have tried to connect everything to ML based use cases and even cover advanced cases where ever I can for this particular batch. Yes, maybe I could have been better but you need to look at the mix. I recieve feedback from one set to cover basics, and other set to only cover advanced. The only thing I can do is to balance both sides. 

That said, You will begin with Core ML Concepts once this module ends next week. You will find that more engrossing. I mentioned in the very beginning that this module will only be math fundamentals. However, I understand your view and you can give this curriculum feedback to Shivank in the AMA."
"@918105882539 
Having 3 confirmation clicks for submitting practice assignment is an overkill?"
I tried multiple times and raised TA help request and he said it is mistake from scaler side and they will correct it but still didn't happened
But recordings are available till 720p only
this course is no use for mee
yes, i actually joined scaler in the SWE track and was sort-of-forced to switch to AI/ML track because how death-like-painful-and-boring it is to work with a deterministic system. no danger. no threat of harm. no risk of death. just CRUD. It numbed my mind and body and heart and soul.
Hi Shivam, Nandani, this side, after a lot of consideration, I really cannot cope with the program. I truly, truly appreciate the help, but I'm really sorry it's not at all possible for me. I would really be grateful if you could pls help in the refund process. pls, I request you 🙏🙏🙏, I'm fairly young in my career, and it just doesn't align well and the current situation, and all I will be left with is just the mental burden and regret. Pls, if there is anything that you can do, pls I request you, pls help with the refund process🙏🙏
What's your problem man. You are sort of attacking everyone who is expressing their concerns. Is this your business ? Let the scaler team and Vishal answer the questions.
Or are you thinking if you counter attack every concern raised by the member with your sarcastic replies, the scaler will provide you extraordinary opportunities ?
I am really hoping I can study peacefully but with the way they are going I dont guess it is not helping anyone. Hoping a quick resolution can be taken in this regard.
Hello guys is it just me or others also have the problem with the scaler dashboard , it is lagging a lot and getting stuck most of the time
laptop no issue I am facing..mobile I am facing issue with recording..raised a ticket too.
"When this Dashboard issue will be resolved if it is taking really this much time should find a way to get all notes and post Lecture content in urgent manner.
@918105882539 @919986128895"
I want to say my colleague who joined 1 month post our batch has the maths for ML module. Unsure why it has been removed for us
It happens to me many times too. The dashboard would be empty & shows some error & retry button
As per customer support , issue resolution time is more than two weeks
It is quite irritating.
They should clarify this before joining itself; giving add-ons later, like an insurance company does, is not good
Also the fees they're charging is also not less
Some basic topics he is not covering if i say something people in this group telling to learn with ChatGPT
Even practical he is teaching as theory
I am behind you @919036371466 you are atleast understanding I am like what is going on , Doubt resolution class is better than actual classes
I should have opted for Udemy. It would been covered in less than 1k.
I am loosing interest day by day
Scaler needs to rethink on these classes
They are not productive at all
Atleast we can expect teacher whose teaching style is bit interesting
there is no point of progress in course without any progress in knowledge
We are paying extra for this after paying dsml course already
@918105882539 @919739601215 No update till date. Pls connect in immediate basis.
I am really in doubt if we are going to be FAANG ready with this level.
Agreed.. This was again kind of repetition of first lecture only
All this could have been covered in first lecture itself
"Ayush, I am good with you
The problem here is Scaler topic/curriculum.
I know you are just covering the topics given and you did it well."
"Hi everyone, we’ve heard your concerns regarding the curriculum and we’re really sorry for the experience you’ve had. Your feedback is very important to us, and to address it in the best way possible, I’d request you to kindly share your inputs through this feedback form. 
https://forms.gle/6tWTa5BFYdvJje1b6 
Once we receive it, we’ll work on your concerns accordingly. Thank you for helping us improve your learning journey."
Can anyone tell why this is wrong?
same here ,i dont know how doubt clearing session will help, dont have any doubts because i not able to follow topics taught in regular sessions.
Like this we are wasting our timw
I am regretting, why I put on hold my current dsml, it was going so smooth
Module test has only 2 attempts but failing to clear that means no completion certificate and no placement assistance? They should give enough time to prepare and attempt it right..
"Ai bot only confusing us.
Only 2 attempts are there not 3."
"How to do it?
Deopped an email to scaler support but i think you guys dont monitor it"
Issue still pending..
I agree because some of us are in masters program as well so marks do matter, i also think there should have been atleast some form of communication for date change so we could have prepared in advance
"It's been over a month now
And we have not yet started with the project classes.
What we will be going to add in project section in the resume?
@918105882539 @919310611138"
need an AMA. test is level 10, what we were taught is level 2-3
This is the problem Assignments are not map to the class. This is the problem what I faced from beginning.
"I am also facing so many issues.
Sometimes unable to login scaler
Please look into this"
"@918105882539 
Making the certication contest compulsory for placement seems unfair. There are many questions where different services which we don't have handson or did not even know how the service works in sync with other service. Please introspect on this."
The Fullstack course does not have a dedicated session SOLID
"Callbacks are good way to raise the concern. However when in a callback the support team commits to come back with answers in few days, it is necessary they should. 
They should not just commmit for the sake of it. 

I got the call back for my query and the guy committed to come back on last tuesday. Its been a week from the committed day and i have not heard from him. Sometimes you just give up when the concerns are not taken seriously."
i had discussion earlier with different mentors but they cannot help regarding the course, since they dont have scalar course knowledge much and they will not be able to help in this case. in selection of elective.
"One questions why hint video of this question is not good? Even it has 3.4 rating still
Scalar did not care to update it.

I feel scaler should check all the videos and which is below 4 rating. It should be updated with better one."
Any way to get out of this program and get the amount refund?
"Hi Nipun and Scaler team for the 5th September class notes is added or uploaded wrongly. 31st August notes are added for 5th September.
Please remove and add the correct notes."
This is really not looking good, this is the result of false information while recruiting students, why should we pay for the mistake, wasting my time and money both.
If this is the way you guys going to continue, I am sorry I will strongly put my case for opting out of the program.
It's been so many days now that I have been begging u guys
There are people visiting my home like goons almost to get the money
I am begging you all to cancel the course I have gotten a Mumbai hight court order and a complaint against me from the le nder
When is someone gonna call me and fix the problem
I have till date not got any calls abt my problem that I am facing
And I have been begging for this since a long time
The issue is in portal.. Let scaler team reply on this.
Ii raised a callback through support in the morning. They asked me to redo my assignment and resubmit. I did that and it’s not resolved.
"@918105882539 @918105971511 I have reached out to the right people and the right channels, yet today I find myself in a difficult position through no fault of my own. This situation has arisen purely due to poor management—specifically, leaving a trainer in the middle of the batch and then simply stating that a morning batch cannot be accommodated. Such an approach does not help.
 
It is your responsibility to address and resolve each student’s query. Why should a student like me have to suffer in this way—left without a batch and with my learning disrupted? This is clearly a mistake on Scalar’s part and also on the part of whoever transitioned the batch from morning to evening without consulting each student, while also leaving the trainer mid-training.
 
I strongly demand a resolution and the right to have my request considered seriously—for a morning batch, or at the very least, a weekend batch. This group was created to address learner concerns, and I believe this is the right place to resolve such issues. I have already reached out through the support model and shared the response I received. Now, I request your immediate help in resolving this matter instead instead of sharing The Guidelines which ever written in favour of you !"
If this cannot be addressed promptly and effectively, and a proper resolution is not provided, I will have only  choiceto Quit  from Scalar and fight for my best rights, Please consider this carefully. Thanks , Please do let me know any help that you can offer me Except  Providing Recording To Continue my learning with scalar.
There are not that many job opportunities in your career portal I have applied a lot in other job portals like Naukri, linkedin and all
We also understand but half of take class to other it’s create confusion
That’s not acceptable
I already tried contacting via bot no response from it
I already reached out but did not recieve a callback
I have few concerns about mentor
In many questions I found that the question is incomplete and sometimes the test file itself is wrong
Also many of topics still not covered
Grafana and Kibana is not covered
Spring Cloud Gateway not covered
Many of things in HLD done in very fast way and not deeply explained
Many important topics you face in interviews and then felt regret
Am I the only one who was disappointed?
It seems that I am the only one not happy with the current instructor
using latest version. Rejoined but still issue persist
I am also , already dropped a feedback on portal when it asked after multiple attempts why u r not selecting..
If I do devops course it is waste of time and money for me
If cybersecurity course is no there. Please refund my money
@919810354223 It seems that many of us are not happy with Ritwik Malla as instructor in evening batch
I request you to change the instructor for Product Analytics
I gave feedback on his first lecture(feature engineering 3)...but seems no improvement in the practice session
Most of us here are working professionals, it's very hard to manage time also... They should give us enough time
@919267924464 unable to reach out to my LSM for quite some time. I have dropped you mail with my queries please help to get those resolved .
Just attending modules and covering topics without properly completing backlogs is meaningless.. Also program itself is designed to be longer, but let's say u don't have proper understanding and proceed further. Then it will create dissatisfaction
"I won't reach out to anyone.
They reached out to me when they needed a client/customer/student/etc.

You do the thinking now, who should reach out to whom.
I'm not reaching out to anyone for that matter..

My EMI is due day after, I'm holding that for now ."
"And this is your support system.. you are reaching out after 8 days of priority matter..
Your owner is free to throw out someone from a WhatsApp group in less than 30 seconds but you can't reach out for 8 days..
Dont be on the same path as Byjus, otherwise you'll meet the same fate.."
"If you can't handle things, I can do it for you for free..
And tell that smart a** to go easy on his arrogance!"
"So does that mean, we shall not utter a word if you guys keep changing the curriculum.
Secondly you are most welcome to highlight any abusive language I hv used in that community group. I'll take my words back in that very same group if u can show me where and when I did that 
*Frustration*!! Yes 3lacs is a big amount, and if we are not getting what we were promised, then yes , it is natural to feel frustrated.
*Response delay* - yes, obviously, you'll write your mistake points in the last. Now this response delay is your problem to tackle. You have to do it at ur end. If the volumes are high, the dissatisfaction is supposed to increase. Handle it in time before people starts writing bad reviews about you guys online. Handle it before it's too late. Online image is what defines an online business model"
"Even if u had changed the curriculum with good intentions, do let the stake holders know.
No information, is negative publicity!
You should know it by now."
The same instructor was assigned to one of my batches during DAV2. At that time as well I was not happy with his style of teaching. If you are planning to go ahead with the same instructor, then please change the batch for me
Hey i have shared my views already that i am not interested but still i am getting calls from different people & also it's difficult to change to a separate program which is longer than a regular program
"When n where this discussed? What’s the process to make such changes without any involvement with the students?

How can you expect availability as and when needed?
Faculty is being changed in the middle of the course, who will take the responsibility that there is no impact on the way of teaching?"
This question was not addressed in the AMA even though it was raised. It was fobbed off with "there will be communication coming". Very disappointed at the lack of clear communication from Scaler on this and other issues.
Neither am i able to get a callback from @918105882539  i had requested for a call 2 days before and was assured scaler team will get in touch in next 24 hours but still no callback recieved.
When a detailed curriculum isn't known, it creates confusion when some changes are made.
May be, you should add another option, not agreed as course will get extended
There could at least be a prior communication before rolling out decisions unilaterally. It helps at least to make people feel that they have a say.
Case studies and projects were not listed out separately. Part of the lack of clarity and communication that has been persistent since start of the batch on August 13th.
If someone is doubtful of the module, it doesn't matter for him whether course extend or not.... What will I do by completing course if I have all doubts
@919986128895 @918105882539  - this amorphous "we will be ... " statements are what is being pointed out as being a problem. There are a lot of "we will be ..." statements  put out verbally and in writing by Scaler employees and representatives without delivering concrete information.
And one more humble request to scalar team .... We need more kind of hands-on related assignments .... Like building things from the scratch .... Or else it will be really difficult to follow up and apply the topics on real time scenarios
That doesn't answer any of the questions. Why change in instructor and timings?
@919986128895 @918105882539 With all due respect, the "https://shorturl.at/K4Rf7" is a link to a document without any dates. The topics listed won't even be taught in the order listed in the document - according to the current dashboard listing of classes till December 1, 2025. This message is yet another example of poor, imprecise communication that is creating confusion in students like me.
I have already raised the concern about adding DSA as mandatory in the dashboard and considering attendance and PSP with AIML doesn't make sense. Adding DSA now in the middle of the course without discussing with us is not really making sense. We have already adjusted our work accordingly for the AIML and keeping the PSP high, now adding DSA as mandatory reduces our PSP and rank which is really discouraging
"Hello,
My future classes are still not updated !!! 
I opted for FULL STACK specialisation and it is showing that tomorrow morning is my class of BACKEND !!
PLEASE UPDATE ME over this issue and UPDATE MY DASHBOARD."
How can they suddenly change it .. 🤔 they can’t make optional class to mandatory in middle of course @918105882539
Half baked code execution platform
tried contacting customar support this is where the link is leading me , On "example.com"..
Too strict. That mistakes are not even counted for
Waste of time
"@918971262742  
What is this make sure you platform features work properly have you tested the mobile camera snap feature in real it’s an headache every time"
There was a popup which told me to reload the page to continue, When I reloaded I got disqualified.
We paid huge amounts so there must be flexibility according to feedback
I don't live in india and the mail replies im giving they aren't responding
@918105882539 You also try to understand that reaching out to the support team during some critical moments does not make sense, and that's why a few admin and support members are here in the group to resolve and inform us during those times. All the issues do not get resolved just by contacting the support and it also depends upon the issues too. Every time reaching out to the support does not make sense e.g. in yesterday's scenario. In Tarun Asthana Sir's group there is a member of the support team named 'Aakanksha Singh' who herself intimated in the group but you were just giving us timings for contacting the support which was not helping in any way. Hope you also understand our concerns.
This time it took me 1hr and a change of 3 mobile phones to set up for the proctored exam.
But its all in vain
Linking DSA to our PSP and attendance, half along the course is unfair to those who didn't attend the sessions or watched recordings afterwards as per their convenience, given it was formerly optional.
"@918105882539 I respect others opinion. But I didn't like his style of teaching. 

Can you please change the batch for me with some other instructor.

If possible I prefer a batch with *Satish Atcha* as the instructor"
Thank you, Scaler team, for the frequent reminders of my ₹3.10 lakh investment—unfortunately, one that hasn’t yielded the value I had hoped for.
Previously said that DSA is not mandatory...now you guys made it mandatory for us.. how can I learn all backlog classes? Why are you guys creating a hectic situation? Could you please inform the next new DSA batch will start details? @917353029696 @919267924464 @918105882539
Support unit never responds as pointed by Udit already kindly let us know if it's doable. Thanks
We want a ama . N give us a proper date when it can happen. Not again a message that you are working on it.
Y we should justify ? Attending 4 classes in week is very difficult.. we have not enrolled for 4 classes .. this should have been informed during admission .
"@918105882539 
Hi @Scaler Team - We need a concrete date for the DevOps projects that were promised at course start and middle of devops modules. It's been 18 months and students struggle in interviews without hands-on projects to showcase. Please provide specific start and completion dates by today - we can't keep waiting  'working on it' responses. This is directly impacting our job prospects.

Hi team @918105882539 we want to learn few very important concepts which were not taught properly in the Miscellaneous topic class, I request you to kindly arrange a session by Saurabh sir so we could learn better.
"Why it is rescheduled without our consent??
Yesterday I raise the concern about it in the session!!
What’s the use of that poll’s response and chat messages if you guys decided without reaching out to us.
@917829555524 @918105882539"
Yes now indirectly saying psp will be impacted etc etc is not good. We committed to something based on our understanding that these many classes are there and ds u can take as optional .
This is not right @918105882539 if we want a instructor for our module then why it can’t be done
If you care about students @918105882539 then please listen also what students want
He was directly going to solutions without explaining the tricks or intermediate steps
"Hi guys i have created students only group for our batch
Please join if u r interested 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/EKMfaZS1feIJEiuSOQnyHD?mode=ems_copy_c"
It is kind of a hiding mistake or giving the deviation to the learners.
Why we are taking this much gap ,23 sep is too late to start for next module,it will break our momentum.
@918105882539 only 4 classes are there in October with huge difference, why??
Why does the schedule keep changing in a matter of days,  previously it showed text processing and image pre processing modules.
All this doesn't make sense and don't seem professional
@918105882539 can you please check if some mistake has happened from technical perspective.Can you please make our course consistent as per the plan showed earlier. We have planned our career matching with ur timelines.please don’t make this course as 2 year course.
Hello @918971262742 @918105882539 we are facing lots of issues while solving assignments.. platform is not good. Majority of the questions doesn't belong to that class so we have to use Google or chatgpt to solve them and Even after giving correct cmds and correct docker file it's not working and  error messages are also not proper to get the clarification of the issues
Yes I have highlighted this concern in class as well now I feel they're more concerned to get the portion done as quickly as possible - which should not be the case - I would request to keep a minimum of 4-5 working days between module test and start of next module else we won't be able to catch up
hi team I changed timing for the batch but cant view the todays class on dashboard
There is lack of coordination between the topics for every class vs the one who teaches compared with assignment questions. In the AMA session we were told regarding problem solving session which are yet to happen
"@918971262742 @919996203771.
Is this really the case that the learners need to do projects on their own?
Because scaler support said that which ever projects are their in the modules that are the only projects we are having.
Like is this a joke or something?
Could you please tell me one project in the whole curriculum which I can include in my resume or it is making my resume outstanding??"
This is the high time and we need an AMA because this is not the way it is going to work..
Even after requesting many times… what is the problem that you people face to schedule a AMA session for us. This is not acceptable from scaler team. @918105882539
I agree this is not a responsible behaviour. Not professional at all
They should take our career more seriously. Why is it so hard for them to just comply for basic demands and do not make false promises
"This is not done at this point of time..
Are you even understanding the consequences of this from a learner's perspective?
Then why giving professional level certificate questions in the contest with cuff off of 75%  and expecting the learners to clear that without having any hands on experience..
Is this really even making sense to you.
@919996203771 @919810354223 @918050909598 @918105882539"
Im not sure when these promises will be fulfilled
@918105882539 please look into this one . it is almost 1 month no update on this .
Have we paid to listen for your apologies.
Go get naman or ayushman for the same . We don't want your apologies
N if you can't give that . Pay our money back .
Enough is enough
Either get us a proper solution, get the ama with ayushman and Naman or our money. No more your apologies
The promises made at the beginning of the course—such as AMA sessions on request and timely responses to any course-related issues—seem to have been forgotten. Where did all these promises go…
You guys are actually sounds like scammer.
So better put them on. N don't comeup with your next apologies message. Get us simply a day when ama can be scheduled
You are scammer. Thankyou for deleting
@918105882539 to be honest with out hands on experience on tools it is difficult to survive job . as you know how market is growing vast with AI . classes and assignments are not helpful . now a days interviewers are asking questions based on scenarios and  how the current flow you r working on current company  explain step by step . some interviews in the live interview asking to screen share write script for bash terraform etc . that is the reason POC is very important and especially working on devops tools are very important . Demo project is very important . try to understand my concern .
My opinion isn't very high for scaler right now. My team was planning for a training with scaler i told them reality. Now they're going with other vendors
This is quite common with what scaler is doing right now. We have seen this before. Delaying the response as much as they can until it is fully burning issue. The same happend before the start of Aws module. They just do not treat the learners as a priority.
Even my manager asked me if we should go with scaler i showed her these messages she flipped instantly
Good job. Nobody is having very high hopes with them. Promises made and not executed is quite common here.
Showed them the reality now they're searching for other vendors
Earlier at least some one from team will come and answer. Now what we see is some representatives from so call scaler “support” (unsupportive) will come and paste some random message of apologies with no commitment to timeline. Mind you “soon” is very vague term and does not show you are committed. Wish i should have said “soon” when I was enrolling for scaler
The guy who called me for scaler support never came back when he committed he will call me back on 2nd sept. That is the level of commitment and trust We have in you. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Is there anyone we can talk to from Scaler apart from Support in terms of curriculum? It seems that Support just doesn’t know lot of stuff.
"@918105971511,
We’d like to clearly understand two things:
1.	What caused this issue to start (the gap/trigger)?
2.	What specific actions are being taken to resolve it?

Right now, we mostly get updates that say “we will get back to you soon,” but without clarity on the root cause or corrective measures. Having direct answers to the above points will help us track progress and ensure accountability."
"Hi @918105882539 

Please answer the query below:
Initially DSA classes were not mandatory. But with last week's change it was made as a mandatory. Also it got included in with scores and attendance streak affected and changing the time slots without our opinions in which most of us are affected with overflowing negativity from your side. What's the best solution you will give on this??"
Nobody from this group seems to be addressing students’ concerns or questions. There is no proper clarity or responsibility in handling these issues. After moving to the evening batch, I found myself in a very confused state about my learning journey with Scalar. Even after detailed explanations, it feels like nobody here is committed to solving students’ problems. The focus seems to be only on completing the batch, regardless of how well students are able to grasp the concepts or whether quality content is being delivered.
Need to escalate few things it’s beyond my patience
"Who knows, what's valid when it's changing day to day.
I was told today that the dashboard is updated with lectures till the end of february, which is 5 months from now.  I.e ML coding module is supposed to be completed by then.
If I compare ml coding from list shared by LSM, Anomay, dashboard. 
Lectures/topics seem to be cut down with each update we receive.
I don't know what to infer from this.
I don't understand when 4 batches have already started , why these many changes happen to the curriculum."
"@918105882539 , @919986128895 , @917829555524 
@919348350631  has a point - one that is relevant to other students in the batch. 
1. Scaler has made changes to the curriculum/topics/modules (call it what you may).
2. The way the changes have been presented can be interpreted by reasonable people as reduction/consolidation in the topics.
3. Communication about the above changes to the August 2025 batch has been confusing at best.
4. The elimination of the Maths for ML module from July 2025 to August 2025 just adds to the chaos created above.

So, Chayancy/Anomay/Shivank should clarify this publicly, preferably in this chat group itself. 

(a) Chayancy's response to Nikhil V. to raise a callback is not appropriate in this context - the issue should be addressed publicly. 
(b) I am not sure why Scaler is unnecessarily engaging in an own-goal and hurting the reputation of the Scaler brand in this manner. 
(c) Added to this, the marketing upsell email to get students to buy the Scaler ""university"" product unnecessarily diminishes the integrity that so many of the Scaler instructors work hard to uphold.
(d) The Sep 11, 2025 AMA session could have been an opportunity to clarify and put unease at rest. Unfortunately, the lack of clear, concise information at that session and immediately after just made the confusion and chaos worse."
Hello @918105882539 I would like to bring a point here, the gap between LLD3 module and HLD is 35days. I personally don't want this long gap for next backend project module. As per curriculum, the duration of course was 11.5months but the HLD itself is finishing  after 14 months. Please schedule the project right after the HLD is completed.
"Hi @918105882539,
All these points are valid. Please consider them and let us know why so many confusions are arising regarding the curriculum."
I did ask the person about preread before registration and they said only python basics is enough and it was only shared, if they shared these it would have been helpful... as this is first batch there are learnings
@scaler! Why are assumptions being made it's a beginner module so treat it like a beginner many here don't even know how to properly write syntax and the coding part why are we skipping ahead of crucial parts.
There should be penalty on instructor if 25% people unable to complete assignments
Waiting more than 30 min no response
I have given feedback that no one takes action and the majority wins if 90% are given good feedback the rest 10% are ignored.
No, loom is just a scaler platform to watch recordings nothing else
"One thing I have noticed that they have stopped the peer review and the reviews are getting done by some AI application.  Especially review of the last two business cases were done this way. So I am not sure what could their response will be.

 Last time I had a different issue (one of the question in the module test had multiple correct options instead of one) and even though they understood (accepted by my tutor for the module and also reviewed by teaching assistant) they are on wrong side, still they were not ready to rectify it or the people who agreed with me don't have the access/permission to do it. 

Anyway report it, also please keep us posted about your experience."
Hi @919606019788 @919267924464  i have joined my mentor session scheduled at 9pm today but my mentor is not available kindly note thanks
Last issue of mine was did not get resolve
There is no option for support from the Test page
"Hi @918105882539

Our Tableau classes are set to start on the 17th, which is just two days away. As of now, neither you nor the management has confirmed about @919739832220 sir leading the Tableau sessions. 

I am concerned about the delay in providing this update. Why is it taking so long for the team to communicate? It seems not required to wait until the last minute for information. I expected that Scaler management would be responsive to students' needs when I joined, and keeping us uncertain about such an important decision is not in the best interest of our learning experience. Please Dont keep us anxious on this."
@918050909598 why the classes are getting rescheduled again and again and we are not getting any notifications in advance?
This is repeating continuously. At least let us know in advance that classes will not be held or it will get rescheduled
Keeps sending emails about consistency, but can’t stay consistent itself.
@917299362499 Is there any update on lab extension. @918105882539 @919810354223 if Scaler has extended 5 weeks of content then Should give some extension in lab as well. Previously the content was short and might not require so much of lab as SQL was heavy in the past module. But now Spark and other things are heavy that too 5 weeks content added then why Scaler is not understanding the basic thing that we need some time for doing hands-on.
We were raising call from Scaler support too but not getting help from there as well. They are simply telling talk with your instructor
"I sent an email to support@scaler.com but that email box is unmonitored.
I also talked to support chatbot but it doesnt provide any help in this context."
None is responding properly
Yes there is no option i already raise concern to support team waiting for response
Even the first test had its issues with the screen freezing and taking too long to autocomplete, but we didn't get any resolution to it.
😂 This is becoming a nightmare now, i did'nt expect that
This course is not going anywhere
It's been a over a month, and we haven't moved a inch
"I would also like to highlight the genuine concerns of mine for whom the 9:00 PM evening batch (which for me starts at 12:00 AM midnight) is too late. Not every student will be able to attend classes effectively at that time, and this could negatively impact both their learning progress and long-term career growth. Even if one or only a few students are affected, the impact on their learning journey is significant and should not be overlooked.
 
I sincerely request that these challenges around batch timings be reconsidered. If such concerns are not addressed properly , it may disrupt the continuity of learning. I have already tried reaching out to the official admins/problem solvers in the group, but unfortunately they have not been responsive during this difficult time.
 
Therefore, I strongly request that Scaler explore alternatives, such as allowing impacted students to shift to a morning or weekend batch, or arranging trainers accordingly. Simply asking students to continue with timings that don’t suit them does not add value either for Scaler or for the students."
"@918105882539 I want to clarify that I am using this chat only to raise my *learning concerns* , nothing else. When the batch transition was not handled properly, it created difficulties for some of us. I was originally in a morning batch, and my request is simply to be placed back in a morning batch. If that is not possible, then assign me to a weekend day batch would be a fair alternative. Another option could be when a new morning batch starts,please add me there.
 
This is a reasonable request, and I believe it should be possible to accommodate. Hearing from the Scaler team that such concerns “cannot be accommodated” or “cannot be helped” is very disappointing, especially when it directly impacts students’ learning experience. The Support Team hasn't done this batch timing changes and They have no scope if you feel like They have scope Please share contact, I will message him as well and update you the status,  and I would request to address this concern properly please"
@919267924464 my mentor session not happened yet. There are no slots showing... i have requested for slot and on that got message you will get notified withinh 24hrs... and today there is no update... this is pissing me off... if you don't have mentors for experienced guys then won't promise at start... I need this to be get resolved asap or else Im thinking otherwise
If @919739832220  sir wont teach us
"Hi This is Santhosh from DSA sept 25 eve batch,

Actually I have an issue with one of the classes, it's a contest actually and it was supposed to be conducted yesterday ( 15.09 ) but unfortunately due to the instructor un availability it was postponed to today 16.09 9 to  10:30

i didn't actually expected this, I have plans for today evening and I definitely won't be available for the contest"
If they plan such mock interviews why can't they teach and make us practice at same level
But interview questions are really tough, they should have included these topics as part of curriculum
Its giving some suggestion and moving to  next question when I ask doubts
"Rank question was asked which is a window function if it can be solved without using window function then also it was not taught.

Other question was customer whoes 2nd login is within 7 days . So  why our curriculum does not cover questions like it. 

That shows scaler is not teaching complete curriculum that is required to clear interview but design mock interview so we can not clear it."
I have connected but I did not get proper response
It seems whole day of chasing scaler call
After joining scaler this is 3 time I am chasing to connect fist time it went well second time I have to struggle and same this time as well
No suitable mentor found for my goal.
As per customer support , issue resolution time is more than two weeks
This is not reflecting on the platform.
I am not getting any call backs
"Hy All

https://chat.whatsapp.com/BnzKK8UAhQ6ERE2yBRKVBe 


Hey everyone! I’ve set up a group just for students where we can share ideas, ask questions, and discuss anything related. Feel free to join if you’d like—it’s totally optional and meant for open, no-restrictions conversations"
"I’m again saying this, what ever is being discussed for a topic is not going to be enough for a good interview.
If you don’t believe me, just look for a healthy interview experience on any topic, you will face the reality."
"@Everyone I asked Scaler team to provide data about FAANG selections.
They didn’t provide it and said they are working to publish it.
“I don’t see a single selection in FAANG in last 1 year”
It’s serious for those who came here to learn something for getting selected in big techs"
I agree to this. All I can see some very low to mid range companies and the selected students names are invisible on LinkedIn to connect and check with them
This is really shocking.. Is FAANG just advertising strategy for scaler?
By looking at scaler syllabus I had given list of few topics not covered in java backend engineering syllabus. After lots of follow ups and emails what I got was only the links of public articles which are published on scaler website. That was really frustrating experience for me
"I also echo the same . My expectation was really different .

We already have beginner and intermediate batch to covers all basics . 

I joined advanced batch hoping instructor will be from some FAANG company . I will able to get most complex problems to be solved and internal architecture understanding.

But in advanced batch , I see we are learning basics only .

I watched recoding of LLD and HLD and there also disappointed we covered not upto enterprise level designs . It’s just seems to be another you tube video.

I am really sorry but we invested more than our college fee here having some expectations .

This is not to blame any one . Our instructor really working hard to explain all basic concepts . This is just highlighting our points . Thanks 🙏"
The point here is even if we highlight the shortcomings of syllabus and topics covered. There is no concrete action taken by scaler team. We are just given answers for time being time passes and people move on with their work
There are small small things which cause pain like not using meaningful variable names in algorithms. All we are given is A, B, C and N. Are these the names we use while we should be coding? What practical knowledge scaler is giving is really the question
"I’m saying this from start, we are only discussing basics
Here we all are engineering students and we know basics (i mean most of us, and atleast in adv batch) and we didn’t come here for basics"
@918105882539 , please address all our concerns and please take concrete action this time
If @918105882539 will not be taking any action then let us know how we can escalate this and to whom.
If this does not get resolved then let’s everyone put this in next class’s feedback form
"@919560683024 I think its your responsibility to check as we don’t know whom to escape this.
Barely anyone is happy what Scaler is providing with this huge fee."
Hi everyone – I’ve already shared your concerns with the team, and they’re looking into it. In the meantime, I’d request you to share your feedback here so we can track and resolve them more effectively: https://forms.gle/YUW9LsnJTRVwxue6A
Yes everyone one please fill this form and ask Scaler not to fool us
This is typical response from scaler team. Can we involve somebody who will understand the syllabus, contents and concerns here?
These basics were not covered in intermediate
This is a simple Google form who will handle this? Last time also we filled the form nothing happened
Can you add somebody responsible in the group itself? Who can address our concerns
"We didn’t say these are not important.
All we are saying we can’t end here.
You want to learn basics, learn it in basic class, no one stopping you.
But advanced class should teach advanced bro"
These are not basic as per the curriculum
I think the problem here is with batch allocations and time.
FAANG don’t care about whats written as basic in Scaler curriculum
We cant hope to achieve much by just disccusing on this group instead lets get SCALER team on call with the whole batch
I agree... but the time period allotted for DSA is not sufficient for Intermediate students... Intermediate students wants to learn these basic concepts first and then go to learn advanced concepts. But Advanced students don't need to learn these basic concepts as they already know them and learn advanced concepts. Clearly there is a mismatch of batch here which I think should be addressed.
Then it's the fault of the curriculum design, I came from intermediate batch and nothing covered there
"Good 👍 
Admin Pankaj has deleted the poll.
Means they have no interest in converting the next class to our double resolution session and hence to solve any issue."
These people should put more effort and add more examples....
"I have asked them to provide me with the recorded sessions on Java 8, Threads, and Collections, but I haven’t received any response. I also requested that they refer my resume to some companies as I am serving my notice period and plan to switch companies once I finish the course. During the course, they assured me that they would help with referrals, but now that my notice period is over, there’s been no help.

I’m paying more for this course than I did for my entire graduation, and I believe you should take action on this matter. Otherwise, what's the point of joining the course? From what I can see, most of the people are being placed in startups."
Does anyone from Scaler care about answering this question?
Hope this feedback from don't go wasted. And we need a live call doubt resolution, not in WhatsApp
It seems ,our feedback is not taken seriously
This is really scary for someone who is on notice period and yet not help from Scalar. This can happen to anyone among us. It is a long term investment. This concern should be taken into consideration by stakeholders.
No response for previous feedback and yet we are asked to give new.
You both are saying the same thing just in a different ways…so the point is alongside basics which may help us to crack maybe some product based companies advance topics should also be included which is require to crack good companies…so no one is asking to remove basics but all others are asking to add advance topics which is not there in course..@917305050607
Hi, this is Nayan Jyoti Kalita from Deepak Sharma Sir's DevOps batch. I wanted to know the reason why you closed our previous groups. Earlier it did not use to happen, the groups were on and since DevOps is a huge course, it doesn't make sense to close the group as we might have further doubts, questions and discussions around those topics and we would like to have it in the presence of our respective instructor, not in the new one. Hope you understand my concerns and reactivate the group
I dont think reset happened. Today the lecture was on clt and CI . We are not even clear on the previous concepts but the lecture is proceeding in the pre defined schedule
Plz update asap else we will waste instructors time and our time  @918105882539
No one has contacted me since
We had the similar complaint for recursion topics also. What about that?
"Hi I'm deepthi 
I would like to ask about the refund due to my son's leg fracture I can't continue any more no one is there to take care of my son.
Should I get a refund ?"
"@918105882539 you are not getting it.
We want more in depth discussions covering each topic with more difficult problem discussed for one and all data structures."
And no one is taking the situation that I am in seriously
@918105882539 we are not only taking about hashing we are taking about entire topic in DSA need to add in depth concept including the existing basics and intermediate
"@918105971511 the main question still remains unanswered—why did you do that?
Everyone here has been supporting you, and in return, we only expected the same support from you. But if this is the reaction every time someone raises a concern, how can anyone feel comfortable giving feedback?

Not a single message from anyone crossed the decorum of the group. Yet, without a single reply from your side, the group was shut down in our faces. After such actions, it becomes difficult to simply “trust and believe” again without clarity.

It’s good that you are now open for a call, but this could have been handled much better from the beginning. No one here is being unreasonable—we are only raising genuine issues.

A few might think that we are dragging this unnecessarily, but that is not the case—this is a serious issue. Having concerns about the curriculum is one thing, but shutting group access on our faces is not acceptable. When we joined, we were promised full support in every respect of this course. What you did is the exact opposite."
So why we have opted for such highly paid course then? Choosing paid version of leetcode would have been better choice than spending so much on scaler. In all your ads for free master classes you refer cracking FAANG interviews. Big dreams are sold in Ads,master classes and sales people and when we take admission it is mentioned that scaler is not for placements people treat you here by shutting group talks on your faces. This is just not acceptable
"When I said that you can’t prepare anyone for FAANG with this syllabus and on Scaler I don’t see a single selection in FAANG in last one year.
He reminded me that scaler doesn’t even guarantee a job, we just prepare the folks.
So we should forget about FAANG, it will be good even if we are getting placed somewhere."
"I did and got a message like within 2 hrs they will call

It’s already 6 hours I didn’t get a call"
Not answering the call
I am not seeing the energy like @919258621685 sir little boring 🙃
hand writing is also pathetic
just giving us false hope..
I connected with the support guy yesterday about this but till now it's not resolved for me.
"@918105882539 .. the request for repeating/resetting batch for past 5 topics was already made in last week. 
And we are still following the current schedule in classes, it doesn't help. Please do needful by evening and update same for tomorrows class.."
Its been made mandatory which directly affects attendance percentage and your PSP percentage as well as placement opportunity
"Perfect,this is the reason why I am not taking interest ☺️in the class we need instructor like Shivank Agarwal .
@scaler bhai please look in priority we are expecting more from you.."
I got a call, they told me they sent me a mail regarding pause, I didn’t receive any from scaler
Hi scaler, almost everyone is facing the issue. What is the use of continuing the current topics if previous topics are not much clear.
Either @918105882539 should have said no in the first place or give a quick response . Sitting on a decision for 5 days has made us create a lot of backlog to finish. Please consider
"Today I saw Scaler ad on linkedIn and as always talk only about MAANG level preparation.
And not able to provide a Single selection in last one year."
i asked the Scaler companion for the support email but it says there’s no official support email for this.
"@918105882539 why are we not getting any update on the concern which we raised.
If there is no update what's the point of filling form and submitting it?"
@918105882539 Why are you taking the survey if you don't acknowledge the students concern
Accountability and responsiveness mechanism is very slow.
Whats the eta we can not sit idle thinking we will receive update soon or later. There should be some point by when issue will be addressed and informe same to the concern raiser.
You are not answering to our questions
Did not receive TA support for the question which I raised
And when we are trying to identify on how many of us are facing the same issues, you are deleting those messages
Deleting our message looks like the @918105882539  is taking away our chance to speak
"Hi @918105882539 , I tried attempting a non proctord Mock interview for SQL, I was bombarded with window function question, I solved one with simple query, but the Ai companion asked me to use window function their, 
Can you help me why this is still happening, 

Also I have a question *why was Window function not covered in the syllabus*
I saw few lecture library recordings , its present their
Why was it ignored for us."
Till date, I do not know who is my support team. Ms Sonu was first called but later on her phone always swaitched off. Can you tell me about the support team personnel
"@ scaler team don’t do unethical activities on the name of the community guidelines 
Most of the people are working professionals not college going teenagers 
So be professional in your approach 
It’s our very fundamental right to express our opinions 
So be professional"
I faced same issue. But looks like scaler don't want to either take the session on window function or change the mock interview
"Iam not happy with today's lecture given by Shreesh tripathi, we want instructor with more conceptual knowledge and rating should be above 4.8 
As iam beginner please help in change of instructor back to Nipun"
I agree with @917416362295 the pace of today's session was quite fast And I don't know why the rush to solve questions in a hurry we did not like his teacher style at all Right when we sync up with nipun teaching style scalar went ahead and changed him that I not favourable for most people.
The entire content for mysql was too basic.
Removing window function from Test does not seems to be a good solution just feels like something missed in the class and now adjusting test accordingly
"Akash rajpuriya
 Mohit uniyal
 Pulkit aneja
 Shivank Agarwal
These 4 instructors only we want from next modules we want best as we paid huge amount for quality education"
Chat bot is not creating ticket
as discussed earlier w support team it was told reattempt 1 will open on 19 Sep but now it shows it's missed
"I am facing issues with elective selection. I don't see any options when I click on the button mentioned in email

And there is no way in website to connect with human agents.

What's wrong with scaler? Why is it so difficult to get human help"
"This bot doesn't redirect to customer representative until I've sent several messages. 

This is not what I want in my life as an experience. 

You should give two options talk to bot or talk to customer representative."
I agree, The process of selecting a specialization feels confusing.
"And today I had to place 4 calls to get someone to talk back.
Rest of the three calls were static noise

And for each call request I had to talk to Chatbot multiple times.

It's not what we came to scaler for.

We want seamless service. We are already very stressed as it is"
Same happened with me as well and won’t able to request call and if somehow happens after some many attempts… call with agent disconnects again and again and didn’t received.. callback and query remains unresolved
Also, I have noticed that the support agents aren't well-spoken
For the lack of a better word, they are rude.
I mean, we are paying lakhs for this.
"Did you even read my previous reply on the same link before posting the same thing again?

This lack of care is what's the frustrating factor of scaler experience. 

We are not some lambs. I expect better experience for the amount of money I'm paying."
"Just put additional button to connect with human agent.
It's as simple as that.

Whoever want to talk to bot can talk via the existing flow.


As software engineer who has worked on chatbots I know it's not difficult to build.


The greed of scaler is what's the limiting factor here."
Looks like Scalar does not even have time to respond to student queries
I still have not received any call
Yes we have 2 Scalar members in this group but they will not respond even if we reach them directly as well.
Yesterday's class have no audio
Hey Chayancy. The bot is unable to assist & the call me portal is also not functioning
All the lectures are linked in previous classes and no one is ready to understand this point
"Can you please tell us where we can speak our voice and concerns if you are trying to tie our neck by removing the *Freedom of speech.*

How it shows healthy by this kind of behaviour. We are positive when the Prakash sir is teaching the class and we are completely positive, but we also want you to understand why the students are raising their concerns now"
An instructor's quality of teaching can be seen from the first day onwards and we are not connecting with the new instructor.
If we are not liking the instructor why are you Scalar imposing him on us do we have to learn according to you or do you know what's best for us!!!
When we raise issues from the Scaler dashboard, they are treated as individual cases. This suppresses our collective voice and prevents us from knowing what issues others are facing.
"@918105882539, we are having only 5 weeks for tableau and by taking 1 week for this kind of things, then with remaining time how can we improve ourself. 

Your guidelines were excellent on how we can express our concerns on how you want to keep only the reviews that you are liking but not the original reviews.

Till now we didn't get any call regarding our concerns from the concerned team, even though we have submitted through the forms and through here chat."
My lsm is also not replying
"Scaler just understands one thing 
This is our fundamental right to express opinion given by constitution in India 
So scaler once again don’t write anything without logic to restrain from sharing thought 
Once again I am reminding u scaler team"
"Till now there is no call back 
Perform ur duty first 
Then ask for further things 
Scaler pls follow some professional approach"
All the lectures are linked in previous classes and no one is ready to understand this point
"@918105882539 

Iam trying to connect with the support team and when i request a call back , it is asking me to login again and it is not working

Help me to connect with the support team."
"Thanks and also is there any issues with the website ?

Why couldn’t I initiate the call with the support team?"
I could just go and watch YouTube If I want to see recordings but who will clear our doubts we are paying for live lectures and expertise.
If you are not able to solve our queries just say so don't beat around the bush.
You should stick to what you have promised. Based on what you have promised, we have planned our days .  Regular classes you changed from Monday to Tuesday. Now I have to move my Tuesday meetings back to Monday now . Everything you are driving as per your convenience.
If you give chance to people, they will vote differently.  Earlier what you had decided ( Friday Evening ) was not  based on our input .  Now you want to decide based on voting, because this works for you.
Hello, Saturday early morning you are upsetting me . I have planned me my days based on your earlier promise. With lot of difficulty i have accommodated Monday to Tuesday and Wednesday to Thursday changes .  You stick to what you promised me .
There are 1000s of free recordings available if I have to go through offline. Why should I join scaler to listen to recorded sessions.
It was decided that the classes would be on Friday .. why are we changing at the last min?
Well, you have recordings for all the classes rite including ML , MLOps etc etc ... Share the recording and say , if you have any doubts TA will help .. why even conduct live classes then
why you didn't tell me this at the time of joining Scaler that you will be changing the timings randomly. I wouldn't even opted for the course. I know how to manage my learning. I need it Friday evening. Hope you understand and have patience
"You had given Saturday as the only option in the form and saying majority of you have opted for that.. you give the option for Friday also and then look for the responses.. 

As you could see from the last few weeks discussion, almost everyone is looking for Friday DSA session"
Please refund my money, this is not working
You are imposing this without considering the broader opinion. This is purely your organization’s decision, so please don’t portray it as if the majority has chosen it.
Why have you not given Friday as option itself .. so, you have decided it as Saturday and not the class members
Saturday night will be really hard to attend. If you want us to see the recordings only then why schedule it at the first place only. Just give us the recordings and share the assignments
"One feedback scaler team; I like the course I signed up for for AI/ML, it may require a little patience in the beginning especially sometimes, but I like it at an overall level.

But the transactional communication is overwhelming, things should be more around pure learning with the whole group, would request you to please structure these communications such that they don’t require any kind of mental space of a person whom it is unintented for. Should that require splitting the batch into two, may be that’s one solution to it. I run on a very tight schedule and 2-3 hours of monthly transactional sessions are completely unaffordable for me and are such a turn down, not sure how much confusion around DSA sessions will this group bear more. Please help structure these communications such TRANSACTIONAL communication please, if possible."
"I was taking mock interview today and very first question asked that was about window function. And I was totally blank as we have not been taught window function in classes.
@918105882539 please fix this."
"Yes these scaler guys don't care about any one 
I had raised many concerns about my last instructor they did not do anything now they lacture us about this"
"Daljeet buddy asking me calm down
When I am referring my basic right after paying huge amount of fees"
I agree with Smitha here , a lot of us might not want weekdays and saying recordings will be there beats the purpose of having joined a live class … that’s just backup . Please don’t keep saying we have recordings, because that’s not what we chose scaler for .
Haha , same with me even video explanation is also wrong .
Dear scaler team its very disappointing that despite multiple requests for call from support team no one has tried to reach out to me. Food delivery apps resolve conflicts faster than yours. I would be escalating this to all the levels possible. I am not here just to pay your fees you are supposed to assist me in my journey. And for sure I am not referring any one to scaler ever.
I am sorry but it's a bit unfair though, We aren't allowed to connect with each other.
Please answer why you have not given Friday as an option vote ? Why decided to keep only Saturday. People are matured enough to decide attending Thursday and Friday continuous classes will ease their learning or not. Your selective responses and not  sticking what you promised earlier shows your tone .
It is not selecting audio device that's why button is disabled. Scaler team please do something.
"Hi scalar team,
Just to point out a few of the incorrect statements made here
1. You have not been transparent with details. For eg, you have not shared how many have actually voted and what were to counts from the actual class strength. 
2. During the AMA class, it was communicated that the DSA class would be held on Friday and not weekend.
3. Not adding the option being asked of you has been unfair for a pretty good number of the cohort in the first place. 
4. As has been mentioned multiple times and completely ignored by the team, we shifted our class from Monday and Wednesdays to other days so as to accomodate Scaler requirements. Please do not make blanket statements that it has been done to accomodate cohort requirements. 
5. I would request you to share  honest reasons for selecting and only selecting Saturday. I would be fine if the reason was instructor availability or operational. But please do not suggest it was for the cohort benifit because as it stands currently, that is not how it is coming out. 
6. I could certainly be completely wrong, but the reason for confusion and the disenchantment is being caused by lack of transparency and not adhering to commitments made. 

Please understand that we as a cohort already have had multiple concerns raised. I would request team to please stand by what has been committed to us."
No map... No reduce... No filter.... No higher order function... No time complexity..... No class????
No idea.. the Scaler team's got to look into this
As per above discussion the test is for python 2 module but the questions were related to python 1 module. This shouldn't be the case. Right?
That’s the problem of everyone and we are requesting Scaler team to give buffer but since they are saying it doesn’t effect in the future then why the point of -3.5 points if we are not submitting, actually what I feel is in the sake of submission we are submitting the case study but we are not able to explore different approaches
Support is very disappointing no one is calling I have the same issue. Escalated multiple time almost every level
"Hi Admins,
No phone calls have been received regarding my query, yet I keep getting repeated calls about the Master’s program. Do you really think I would consider enrolling in the program after such a situation? Please don’t mislead us. I haven’t seen any action taken from your side, nor have I received any updates."
Specially  lecture and assignments completely different not matching
Not linked with module whatever is discussed till now
But here scene is very diffrent initially they assign newly joined instructors as a result we struggle and they styggle too
If money is not being compromised then why quality is compromised
Since we have taken live batch why to refer recordings or going youtube
This happend twice with us we have to beg everytime why?
"Yes absolutely @918790068080 
As we move ahead it becomes very difficult to keep track of past modules  as the ongoing modules itself becoming hectic due to lack of conceptual clarity 
As a result although the academic curriculum is well designed but it is so densed and compact that it becomes difficult for non tech people to grasp thing such a competitive timing"
"And the current instructor also loose patience whenever asked questions which were taught in previous classes . 

Not sure what they think of us."
He is mentioning us only that go do phd in pr9bability instead of telling past doubts he starts blaming us only
Time and again we repeated that previous lecture is not conceptually cleared but due to some unknown reason he doesn’t want to believe and keep scolding whoever asks question and always says that you are wasting time .
"@919993049563  absolutely we have seen that masterclass n all are being conducted by best faculty and in the curriculam it's lagging 
They need to understand that we paid such a amount in order to learn the concepts more clearly and survive in this job market not only to get a degree. Here literally everyone came to learn things and apply from the best industry expert else everyone would have chosen some masters degree from pvt uni or through other mode if it was just for a degree"
I believe that with current lecture bringing up past doubts doesn't help since we have lot of doubts , so it's better to reset the class from pd1 so that it's not for the sake of completing the module rather understand the concepts and go ahead
We paid well then we need quality no low quality instructors will be entertained we are serious candidates
"@918105882539 - hope you are taking notes of the concerns which are raised in the group, 

If you are not able to provide the best instructors then mention in the beginning of the module and we can ask for refund, because it’s a waste of money that even after investing almost double the amount still we are struggling with basics. 

Atkeast for fundamentals you should appoint good or best lecturers. 

And if you are not able to find the time let us know."
Totally agree if we are bound to pay emis then scaler is also bound to provide best instructors and if someone will get some job Or opportunity then it will be scalers benifit also
@918105882539  - Assuming that you would have take. Off for today will wait till tomorrow evening, or else again need to drop mail to escalation which is the last resort.
When instructor is nit good then we have to beg why is this so?
"Yes but they are not listening 
I think nobody is realising  the importance of the current module"
We selected one of the Saturday options, because the Friday option was not even given in the form. BTW, initially, we were told that the optional DSA classes will be on Friday. We all accepted to shift Monday, Wednesday classes to Tuesday, Thursday. This didn't mean we accepted to move the Friday classes to Saturday.
1.problem is that from day one when the module started, the teacher focused on theory. I didn’t learn anything practically.
3 time management of repeasing case studies and lectures assigned and module test should be proper in a well structured way we should not remind everytime
"5 Scaler has to provide best instructors at least for the fundamental classes
6 Assigning new or inexperiences instructors disturbs the whole learning experience and it extends the timeline to complete the module and hence impacting the job opportunities available in market
7 ⁠Focus more on practical rather than theory, theories good but it should be substantiated by practical examples also as solving problem helps in understanding  the concept in an effective manner
8 Provide mock test for the module as we believe the probability module lacks that its a big risk considering it is the difficult module"
"Good Morning,
To Whomsoever It May Concern at Scalar,

We, as earnest learners, wish to draw your attention to a matter of considerable gravity. The current instructional session being conducted has left us collectively perplexed, as the pedagogy employed is neither lucid nor cogent enough for us to apprehend the essence of the subject. In simpler terms, we are unable to discern the head or tail of what is being imparted.

A case study, however rigorous, can only be meaningfully attempted once the foundational concepts are taught with clarity and precision. Without this indispensable scaffolding of knowledge, expecting students to resolve case studies becomes not only futile but also disheartening.

It is not the first instance that we find ourselves compelled to voice this concern. We respectfully implore you to reconsider the practice of assigning instructors whose instructional efficacy remains questionable and whose methods fail to resonate with students from a pragmatic standpoint. Repeated reliance on such “stopgap” teaching compromises both our learning trajectory and the ethos of Scalar itself.

Our humble yet earnest request is this: provide us with an instructor of proven calibre—one who embodies pedagogical lucidity, practical orientation, and an ability to translate complex concepts into comprehensible knowledge. If such facilitation is unattainable at present, we would rather you grant us a temporary hiatus than persist with ineffective instruction, which merely squanders our valuable time.

We joined Scalar with the aspiration of being taught in a tactical and systematic manner—not to forage through ancillary resources such as YouTube or reference books merely to bridge gaps left in instruction. Please comprehend the profundity of this appeal and take expeditious action to redress it.

With due respect and anticipation of your prompt attention,

Sasi EnuaManu"
2.high rating instructors should be assigned as for better concepts understanding and good knowledge grasp
@918105882539  - Please be very clear, we have expressed the issues with the current learning experience, now please tell us whether you will be taking it with the team or you want us to drop mail?
Even I feel the same...there was a dedicated person for each learner who used to respond for your queries a group was also created to raise concerns and communicate...but now he doesnt pick up my call and doesnt even get back to check the issues...this is disappointing...only in the initial days when we could get a refund there was quick resolution
But why the starting date says 16th September. That's not fair
Please go through their Google reviews, you will understand the situation clearly. I regret not checking Scaler’s reviews before enrolling.
Sir, Please check if there is any issue Scaler platform because I'm not able to access pre or post read page when we click on this page it directlyvplays video
The mentor I was assigned to is not responding from past couple of weeks and the Manager for DevOps is also unresponsive. Could you please help me figure out who to reach out to.
I agree, I called and talked to customer service but I didn't get get much information. Just that format of project report is attached and it should be what we were taught in classes.
there isn’t. He isn’t looking at anything. just fooling us.
not sure why does it too long to ask the team - “hey students want an AMA. What time should we suggest” Doesn’t take more than 5 seconds to ask this to the team.
Fridays class recording doesn’t have audio

In the chatbot it's not helping and in the customer care support they are saying to contact in WhatsApp group
Hi I am scaler student I am looking to contact CRM but I have no contact and there is no option to request callback on site. Can you help?
"It’s been around two weeks since I noticed that my lecture and assignment status are not updating on the portal.
For example:
Day 4 (Creating your first ML Model) – shows 1/3 assignments even though completed.
Day 6 (Journey from Machine Learning to Deep Learning) – lecture progress stuck at 97.5%.
I had already highlighted this issue to the Scaler Support Team here in the group earlier, but there’s been no update or action so far.Requesting the support team to please look into this and resolve it at the earliest."
very bad exprerience
"The instructor is not good for the Linux module. He is teaching randomly. 
Instructor Name: Vilas Varghese

Please suggest how to change the instructor."
And also, the queries in the chat is not getting answered
I got all overhead. I think he is not considering some people are very new to this syllabus
"In this pace of learning, I think many of us will sleep at this time. Already we are here after our hectic office works

I am not getting his teaching style at all."
Teaching style is not good
I was thinking if only i’m feeling like this but majority are feeling the same way (not satisfied)😅
Agreed. Not organised I think. Today, it felt like zabardasti class rakh di. There is no plan
A lot of students in scaler have passed every mock contest but still they are not placed. Their particular time period is over and the end of what they get is nothing.
I will just give him the benefit of doubt as bhumitra might have set some solid standards. If next class will be like this. I might put a pause or ask for a new teacher because this module is very important for me
Today's class is totally screwed up. Had high expectations from scaler for their standard. No second thought, if the same continues pause the course
This instructor is like, he is talking talking talking and didn't even bother what's going on.
@918105882539 I kindly request you to reschedule today’s session to tomorrow with a new lecture? Everyone has joined scaler with high expectations to gain  knowledge. However, if the classes continue in the current manner, it may lead to disappoint us. I hope you understand our concerns and take this feedback positively.
"I see 9 people have solved it. Following is the solution I have given. Please let me know if I am going wrong somewhere.

Scaler's test cases are not trustworthy and at least I am not able to distinguish between mistakes I am making vs bugs in test case itself"
"I see 9 people have solved it. Following is the solution I have given. Please let me know if I am going wrong somewhere.

Scaler's test cases are not trustworthy and at least I am not able to distinguish between mistakes I am making vs bugs in test case itself"
"Soz this was the solution you were thinking of providing me?

I had set wrong expectations then.

I thought you will get the testcase fixed"
I feel the class was not well structured and seemed unprepared...I am comparing it with python and DSA modules we had with other trainers...i guess familiarity with scaler tools and way of screen sharing etc was also an issue..
"For me everything was way below the basic level- looked like he was trying to to give a overview of what linux can be like. Even the overview was incomplete, he missed the gnu project, ipc, scheduling etc.
Some suggestions to try out aws ec2 for practicing linus were beyond my head as it could be done in simpler ways like wsl or vm"
have been waiting for a reply from your team member, Arpita, for the past three days. Each time I call, someone answers and says I will be contacted shortly, but it has already been three days without any response
It’s been more than a week since I’ve been raising my concerns. How much longer do you need to call me back?
It seems as though my calls are being deliberately overlooked by your team
The learner mentioned that he hasn’t received a call from anyone yet. He is expecting a call from Arpita, and over the past week, whenever he has tried to reach out, someone else has answered and said they would call him back. However, he still hasn’t received any call so far.
I called customer support an hour ago and was told I would be connected 'shortly.' I’m unclear what 'shortly' is supposed to mean, as I haven’t received any follow-up yet
After the course they will say the same thing when you ask for job ,
Shubham only today I just asked you few things you ignored and moved ahead I really felt very bad and if seeing the solutions is the purpose then I can go through the recorded lectures , I’m here to learn and to get the job , if I will not ful fill your requirement then simply I can’t the job and neither Scaler will help ,
"Ohh bhai scam!
I want to clear that this is not done by me or by someone I know."
"Ohh bhai scam!
I want to clear that this is not done by me or by someone I know."
Though i am requesting  from bot for support  team is not able to reach me
"The scam was done by the name of my friend who's in SDE batch
And the one who got scammed just sent money without double checking and reading such horrible english"
Though i am requesting  from bot for support  team is not able to reach me
Yes beni.. today happened to you. In future someone might be the victim...
"Is this happend is not good for beni 
So sad beni brother
Scammers are used for scaler student data.
We all stay alert"
still no response.....Can Anybody from Scaler team help me out....at least I can watch the recording
@918105882539 I see lot of issues in job readiness code challenge round 1  exam from your end . I have raised concern during the exam in raise issue section . Please look into that and correct the problems
Even I don't understand, why they show much drama rather than they work for the real placement.
"This is exactly what I also resonate with. 

I feel if scaler can have sessions where we are taught the real world experience like what happens in a real project, do we have stand up calls, what is the process from initiation to production of a new change. That way we can claim that we have experience with projects. Right now what we are getting is something which a 450rs Udemy course can give us"
YouTube is way better and free. I learned so much more there than in Scaler.
Better tutors too..
we can blame tutors, they follow as per scaler curriculum. I complained about the course content and speed of completion to scaler many times. what we are learning now in scaler are basic alphabets, in real world there is so much in advance.
"Yes, sadly so. But we can make sure of spreading words and ensuring others don't fall into this trap. 


I mean, I was told this is a new field and competition is going to be very less. 

Also, I was told software testing jobs are going to go away because of automation.

But both the above are false, as we have a huge competition and considering devs use genai to generate code, software testing job demand has increased 😂"
"same bro…before admission they were flexing about 20-40 LPA… after admission they started giving lesson that: i will need to start with analyst job then only data scientist or ml engineer…

also with that big amount of 3lakh…they should teach us upto making LLM, diffusion model and even RL also… but they are teaching just equal to 2-3 udemy courses worth 400-500… recommended jobs coming under 3-7LPA…half of previous ctc…

few months ago i was completely frustrated…i even thought of posting in linkedin…then i decided that no one will listen to a unemployed person crying out in internet…instead i should expose them after i get some success by myself"
Scaler is doing too much advertising. We should help our friends not fall for it just because of the show-off. Totally not recommended.
We all have made mistakes we realised that we have wasted our hard earned money. Like poltician we were sold a false dream and now we are trapped
"I was told there will be ~83 real business case studies which will be taught in course and real time datasets. But not to be seen.

I felt only Yulu and Delhivery dataset was realtime."
the person who marketed me is no where to found…he changed his number when i checked 2-3 months latter after admission
Ya, this will make us feel even worse
"Yes, and the reason why we have to let others know is because of 2 things. One, so that they don't fall into this trap.

Two, so that the market is not flooded with a lot of data science aspirants making the demand for each of us very less."
You’re only entertained by the management until you take admission; after that, there’s no response.
It was promised in one of the AMAs. But not done yet or don’t see it in Dashboard
"We take admissions only based on the requirement from the industry. Right now we are taking in this batch only because we know that there are going to be these many openings by the time your course is done. 

The sales guy said words like this with utmost confidence. Have to learn how to lie effectively from this actually 😂"
I called him just after the first week of class. I was told my EMI will start only after 6 weeks' of class. I called him and he told, he is on leave.  He made lot of promises, as was I was from a non-tech background.
scaler tried to teach us more long before admission…data science ❌ “how to manipulate customer” ✅
I was promised 147% hike on my current package 😂😂, and I asked about current recession condition, they said recession doesn't impact scaler as we are directly connected with companies. I haven't completed the course yet but honestly I dont have confidence with knowledge and practical experience I have gained so far. Let's hope for the best 🤞🏻
College placement far better than scaler
"Not only sales guys attend any masterclass and you would the of fooling people.

In the masterclass Shivank keeps repeating that 92% of those who complete the course with Scaler gets placed through Scaler and the 8% who do not get placed are the ones who are already working."
"I agree with all the points above, just want to share my little anecdote:
So they ran a multi-city league in which they said they would goodie bags to the person with the highest problem solving streak from each city.

I have a streak of around 600 days, so I won from Indore. And all they sent me as a gift was a water bottle😅
I was like, guys you have charged us 3L+ fees, itni to kanjoosi mat karo"
Pyramid scheme 😂
I think instead of everyone giving your comments put a case against scaler and get our money back or promised education
how that works?…3Lakh+2years time…everyone definitely want some its value back
"Ok I see there are many messages regarding the feeling being cheated 

I have 13+ years experience principle software engineer, who has chosen not to take management route and be on tech path

I would say I also took DSML course last year and as many of you have mentioned I got disappointed by the way these guys have taught as they are teaching entry level things and for me I take interviews for people who are having 10+ years of experience itself , I see the gap between their commitment and reality is pretty huge after taking this course 

For me I was committed to a role for 1cr+ job based on my experience but when I see you guys I feel your pain is much higher, I am already working on industry project in my company and have worked with product and service based companies having decent ctc as of now, so what I felt is , for learning and getting entry this cources might help but for a real world job or a job with high ctc which they commit are based on just few people 

Need to ask them what is the placement ratio with high ctc

Like placing 10 out of 1000 is not the number you want for a decent course where people are paying hard earned/borrowed money for their future...

DM me if someone wants to get some insights on the corporate world, would love to share what I have learned in 13+ years and still learn , freely as a good gesture only not for money"
Wasted end of course everyone telling we were trapped
Yes.. I feel the same. If they start as soon as possible that would be great for us.. classes also not scheduled properly I believe please update and start HLD as soon as possible.
"With 5+ years of experience and at position of Data Scientist

I am getting offers from scaler :

1) From another city which i am not intrested in shifting

2) Payscale half my current salary

3) Years of ex. required for those roles 1.0 - 3.0 years

4) Position offered Backend Developer SDE 1/ Frontend Engineer (SDE-2)/MIS Executive/ Business Analyst"
Just attend any masterclass and see the lack of conscience on the part of Scaler. The way they bluff and con the new aspirants about placements is appalling.
"I have tagged the higher officials of scaler and requested them numerous times to introduce us to the person who has got offer of above 1Cr, may be conduct a session with him like conduct sessions showing freshers who have got into DS from other field.

But there is zero response."
Feels exactly like what Byjus used to do
we should spread words… and prevent future candidates from being exploited.
They would respond saying we are learning a platform not a placement agency , your skills would define the placement even if admins would read this that's what they would say, the placement carrot is for making us enrolled
"That is fine but in that case why are they telling new aspirants that 92% of Scaler students got placed?

Is this claim correct?

I dont know a single DSML person who has got a decent job through Scaler"
we can not get what we lost…2years, 3 lakhs, lost hopes etc etc… this is our fault also…because the dreams made us blind…we can still stop such organisation from growing further to do the same to next fellow dreamers… also remember the mistake we did so that we evolve…
"Its extremely painful to see Scaler lie through their teeth in the masterclasses and con students just as they did with us.

Please attend masterclasses and see what they say."
In my case all my friends are aware of what scaler made me experience and mock me for joining it. I trusted scaler will enable me to make a switch from my current career and quit my existing job 😂
Thats why it is painful to see what Scaler and specifically Shivank Agarwal claims in the masterclasses.
Yes, and hence i havent learnt anything new
"They have mentioned course to be 10-16 months and if its taking 2 years without break/delay its a big red flag.

This was a big issue i raised to them when in first 3 months only 1 module was completed"
"Why do i go in FAANG if the work culture doesnt fit with mine ?

I did join this for placement, but for learning which I havent since a year 😜 (Advanced Batch)"
After hearing this it becomes very difficult to believe in the extremely tall claims Shivank Agarwal makes about himself in the masterclasses
Post reading all the messages and found it to be really disheartening. Does scalar certification have value in the market or is it considered by the current organisations? If not, then what's the procedure to stop EMIs and exits from here. Instead we use scalar for wasting time and energy including our hard earned income.
We need our funds back from them or need placements.
"I am scared to hope for it as I have already experienced a failure due to expectations 😞.

But yes, I always wanted to have MacBook. And I didn't want to buy one with EMI. Now I feel like I could have brought one instead of joining scaler and still have extra cash left"
"Very true 

Rather we spent this much of time with them we could have spend the thousands of the amount to buy a course from deep learning portal to get higher skills with trusty worthy certificates from them which are very much valid"
and guys, how’s ur career guide/ mentor assigned to u…. mine do not ask me anything, not even about my progress or placement…i only schedule one to one when i have major questions related to project or resume… that is too after 5-6months
We are already outdated about what is being taught. They haven't even started any class on Gen AI or AI even. By the time we start with the scalar, we will be already lagged behind by others.
Same for me. Every time he says you can message me on LinkedIn. But when I do, there's no response at all 😂
"3L*at least 20 people who have felt cheated from Scaler is 60L😳

If I had that much, I would quit this craze for jobs and would have retired early or joined a non hectic job."
Most probably hld ki classes lld or baaki classes ki tarah hanesha sceduled nahi rehti . Sometime it delays because kf perfect teachers availability etc etc etc
That's the sad part. New joiners must be stopped when existing people still don't have jobs
Please no, the no. of times scaler has asked me feedback are more than the no. of orders Flipkart delivered every minute
Not sure they will do it or not, I asked them to add Tarun to add into this group and they didn't eventually I had to do it myself. It's better if you can add them on your own. Thing will move faster if we do not rely on the.
https://discord.gg/24Qt8rgrQ
Let's start giving feedback on Quora, google and other social media platforms to rescue others from this scam or trap.
I did entire RNN, LSTM, transformer, self-attentionntopics from there and nothing comes close
This is the worst process in Scaler.. I haven’t seen anything like this.. if they don’t believe us then better they can have proctor for everyone..
Ya, this will make us feel even worse
Please no, the no. of times scaler has asked me feedback are more than the no. of orders Flipkart delivered every minute

the person who marketed me is no where to found…he changed his number when i checked 2-3 months latter after admission
I called him just after the first week of class. I was told my EMI will start only after 6 weeks' of class. I called him and he told, he is on leave.  He made lot of promises, as was I was from a non-tech background.
"I’ve completed all Scaler tests, collected all the certificates, and applied for placements more than 160 times — but honestly, I haven’t seen much impact.
It seems these tests don’t play a crucial role in the placement process. Maybe it’s time Scaler focuses more on connecting students with actual opportunities rather than repetitive assessments."
We need our funds back from them or need placements.
I think instead of everyone giving your comments put a case against scaler and get our money back or promised education and job
You’re only entertained by the management until you take admission; after that, there’s no response.
I was promised 147% hike on my current package 😂😂, and I asked about current recession condition, they said recession doesn't impact scaler as we are directly connected with companies. I haven't completed the course yet but honestly I dont have confidence with knowledge and practical experience I have gained so far. Let's hope for the best 🤞🏻
After hearing this it becomes very difficult to believe in the extremely tall claims Shivank Agarwal makes about himself in the masterclasses
Post reading all the messages and found it to be really disheartening. Does scalar certification have value in the market or is it considered by the current organisations? If not, then what's the procedure to stop EMIs and exits from here. Instead we use scalar for wasting time and energy including our hard earned income.
"Ok I see there are many messages regarding the feeling being cheated 

I have 13+ years experience principle software engineer, who has chosen not to take management route and be on tech path

I would say I also took DSML course last year and as many of you have mentioned I got disappointed by the way these guys have taught as they are teaching entry level things and for me I take interviews for people who are having 10+ years of experience itself , I see the gap between their commitment and reality is pretty huge after taking this course 

For me I was committed to a role for 1cr+ job based on my experience but when I see you guys I feel your pain is much higher, I am already working on industry project in my company and have worked with product and service based companies having decent ctc as of now, so what I felt is , for learning and getting entry this cources might help but for a real world job or a job with high ctc which they commit are based on just few people 

Need to ask them what is the placement ratio with high ctc

Like placing 10 out of 1000 is not the number you want for a decent course where people are paying hard earned/borrowed money for their future...

DM me if someone wants to get some insights on the corporate world, would love to share what I have learned in 13+ years and still learn , freely as a good gesture only not for money"
"Yes, sadly so. But we can make sure of spreading words and ensuring others don't fall into this trap. 


I mean, I was told this is a new field and competition is going to be very less. 

Also, I was told software testing jobs are going to go away because of automation.

But both the above are false, as we have a huge competition and considering devs use genai to generate code, software testing job demand has increased 😂"
"Not only sales guys attend any masterclass and you would know what art the of fooling people is.

In the masterclass Shivank keeps repeating that 92% of those who complete the course with Scaler gets placed through Scaler and the 8% who do not get placed are the ones who are already working."
how that works?…3Lakh+2years time…everyone definitely want some its value back
Scalers discord is also dead
"Very true 

Rather we spent this much of time with them we could have spend the thousands of the amount to buy a course from deep learning portal to get higher skills with trusty worthy certificates from them which are very much valid"
we can not get what we lost…2years, 3 lakhs, lost hopes etc etc… this is our fault also…because the dreams made us blind…we can still stop such organisation from growing further to do the same to next fellow dreamers… also remember the mistake we did so that we evolve…
"That is fine but in that case why are they telling new aspirants that 92% of Scaler students got placed?

Is this claim correct?

I dont know a single DSML person who has got a decent job through Scaler"
Thats why it is painful to see what Scaler and specifically Shivank Agarwal claims in the masterclasses.
Wasted end of course everyone telling we were trapped
"We take admissions only based on the requirement from the industry. Right now we are taking in this batch only because we know that there are going to be these many openings by the time your course is done. 

The sales guy said words like this with utmost confidence. Have to learn how to lie effectively from this actually 😂"
"Yes, and the reason why we have to let others know is because of 2 things. One, so that they don't fall into this trap.

Two, so that the market is not flooded with a lot of data science aspirants making the demand for each of us very less."
We all have made mistakes we realised that we have wasted our hard earned money. Like poltician we were sold a false dream and now we are trapped
They would respond saying we are a  learning platform not a placement agency , your skills would define the placement even if admins would read this that's what they would say, the placement carrot is for making us enrolled
We are already outdated about what is being taught. They haven't even started any class on Gen AI or AI even. By the time we start with the scalar, we will be already lagged behind by others.
That's the sad part. New joiners must be stopped when existing people still don't have jobs
"3L*at least 20 people who have felt cheated from Scaler is 60L😳

If I had that much, I would quit this craze for jobs and would have retired early or joined a non hectic job."
we should spread words… and prevent future candidates from being exploited.
and guys, how’s ur career guide/ mentor assigned to u…. mine do not ask me anything, not even about my progress or placement…i only schedule one to one when i have major questions related to project or resume… that is too after 5-6months
"They have mentioned course to be 10-16 months and if its taking 2 years without break/delay its a big red flag.

This was a big issue i raised to them when in first 3 months only 1 module was completed"
Scaler is doing too much advertising. We should help our friends not fall for it just because of the show-off. Totally not recommended.
"Its extremely painful to see Scaler lie through their teeth in the masterclasses and con students just as they did with us.

Please attend masterclasses and see what they say."
Same for me. Every time he says you can message me on LinkedIn. But when I do, there's no response at all 😂
"Marketing person told there will be ~83 real business case studies which will be taught in course from real time datasets. But not to be seen.

I felt only Yulu and Delhivery dataset were realtime."
"With 5+ years of experience and at position of Data Scientist

I am getting offers from scaler :

1) From another city which i am not intrested in shifting

2) Payscale half my current salary

3) Years of ex. required for those roles 1.0 - 3.0 years

4) Position offered Backend Developer SDE 1/ Frontend Engineer (SDE-2)/MIS Executive/ Business Analyst"
Just attend any masterclass and see the lack of conscience on the part of Scaler. The way they bluff and con the new aspirants with claims about placements is appalling.
I normally don’t use such words, but the support provided in this program has been below par. The issue resolution process is very weak. Without confirming whether the issue has actually been resolved or not, an email was sent to the participants stating that the issue had been resolved.

We have already cleared mock interviews normally with mentors that you have assigned and you guys were asking us to retake the test and coding rounds with AI . When you are not confident enough with the decision of members you hired...then why did you hire them .
Don’t expect Scaler to listen to us. For them, we are only customers who buy their product. They don’t really care about our opinions. Do you think our words will ever reach the senior people at Scaler? They made these community and creator teams just for show — they talk for a day or two, then stay quiet. Many students have the same problems, but no one takes real action. It feels like they only care about selling courses, not solving issues.
Yes, the false promises and taking students in, is really not a good thing. Don't build hope to shatter it.
We are not getting a proper response, may be because there is no change in tutor
Even I am not getting proper response from the support and whatsapp group from last night.
"We, as learners, currently have no common platform to raise our concerns collectively — this is the only space available for us to express them. We would like to bring to your attention that our claims are genuine and stem from real challenges we are facing.

Despite making high payments and putting in consistent effort, many of us feel that the outcomes have not been appropriate or aligned with the expectations set at the beginning of the program. We genuinely hope the team acknowledges this feedback and initiates meaningful steps to address these issues constructively."
Chatbot is not transferring call to  agent
Chatbot is not transferring call to  agent
There was a WA channel by Scaler called Interview Preparation but Scaler has made it admin only so that no one raise concerns.
"In a devops batch mock interview is only there for dsa and system design 
In a real devops interview no one is going to ask dsa unless its faang company 
What is the point of this is beyond me
I formally asked for a separate batch for beginner and advanced so that we donot face striggles like we did in linux class but that was also ignored 
Not even sure what to do now, so i am studying on my own and I consider the classes as a revision"
What is the point then to pay huge fees for class
"But here are many people who is new to Linux including me so I want that the trainer will teach us from scratch.
We paid this huge amount to learn from basics otherwise I'll left behind and end up with backlogs."
Yes they told me at the time of joining I will be put in advanced batch later I found there is only one batch
"Past couple of days i went through recordings of different instructors for linux, all of them were well prepared with  proper agenda, structured teaching & notes,  keep looking at chats and resolving doubts. I totally respect the vast knowledge and experience but there's a huge difference between knowing something and being able to explain the same thing in easier manner. 
I'm new to all of this, for me last class was 1/10, hoping to see some changes today!"

"For me everything was way below the basic level- looked like he was trying to to give a overview of what linux can be like. Even the overview was incomplete, he missed the gnu project, ipc, scheduling etc.
Some suggestions to try out aws ec2 for practicing linus were beyond my head as it could be done in simpler ways like wsl or vm"
Disappointing and highly hopeless
They are not answering our queries, the last few messages from scaler looks like they are copy pasting tweaking some words 😒😒
We don’t understand. What’s the point of having the same instructor. It’s just wasting everyone’s time. It doesn’t feels fair and the whole batch has expressed dissatisfaction over the last class
Over the weekend scaler trained the tutor, is it? To be more engaging? Doesn't change anything. If this kind of experience is what  you are providing, then don't expect your students to pay heavily. Justify for the money you get from us. If the entire batch is disappointed and you guys are coming back with same answer, you are spoiling the flow and interest
Exactly....they just want to push ahead with same instructor

I am sure more than 90% of batch rated 1 for rating ...what worst they expect from that.
Yet they come up with no changes
Am sure nothing is going to help us with this improved, interactive, impressive session.  these fancy words cannot gain the trust
We are not satisfied with your  response from last week.
If it is the same instructor, then it will be a waste of both money and time for me.
Thats a very good point, but scaler does not allow download the video of their lectures.Initially they suggest one of the plugin, which when i tried it worked but then did restrict that as well.

"Dear Team,

30th October, 2024 I was invited for Meet and Greet from Scaler.
SET Test Result (1st Attempt) - Advanced Batch 

Goal - Transform my career from Data Scientist to Senior Data Scientist

I was glad to find Scaler as platform.
Onboarding communication was with Mebin who has always helped me, solved all my queries and taken all the feedback post every action taken in Scaler.

1st Module : Advanced Python : Instructor Bipin Karla 4th Nov - 27th Nov
Best Part - Hard level daily practice problems
Worst Part - The Problem Solving Sessions

I did go through the depth of the curriculum and found that this course not for me.
I was promised by Mehul and Divy that my dashboard would be upgraded to advanced level and I would see results by Jan-mid.
Mebin was so supportive ran for support here and there and got the doubts solved.
I raised the request to refund team who had almost initiated the refund process as per my request.
Request withdrawn 21st November.

2nd Module : Maths for ML : Instructor Mohit Uniyal 9th Dec- 20th Dec , 3rd Jan - 10th Jan
Best Part - I already knew the concepts, I explored other features of Scaler
Worst Part - Lots of breaks (Understanding Mohit's Leaves)

Modules Explored :
Lecture Recording Library : 
Best Part : Could watch the future concepts and speed up my growth
Worst Part : Felt lacking Newer concepts like Generative AI

Career and Interview Preparations :
Explored Fundamentals and Certificate for same :
Best Part : Mock AI interview bot 
Worst Part : I had to record every response, should be kept instant after beep and have a button for finish else people keep thinking before answering which does not work in interviews

EDA Fundamentals  :
Best part : Test on topics like hypotesis testing, ttest (Score -100, Interview - Hired)
Worst Part (Interview) : I failed a test, did not get result, needed to improve on those concepts, Did reachout to support Assistant Sonu, didnt get a response on same (whatsapp group - closed by her exactly at end of 2 months) Failed Interview Test was on python & SQL

Mentor Sessions : 
Amazing, Abhishek has been a great help to reshape my career. Eager to connect with him again. No worst part here (5/5)

Scaler chat Bot (Beta version) :
1) Basic course knowledge, prompt responses on structured doubt
2) Felt slight week in math as they said 5 is less than rt(5) 😂
3) Not much knowledge for future courses

3rd Module : Intro to ML & NN  Instructor Mohit Uniyal, 20th Jan - 14th Feb Ongoing
Worst Part : Not even 1 session talks about Neural network. It has just Linear, Polynomial and Logistic Regression.
Best Part : heard of AI / ML Program

AI ML Program :
1) Heard 1st time 7th Jan Masterclass by Naman Bhalla
2) Made Mebin drive crazy based on it. He connected me with Pranav for the same.
3) Contacted many of support team members on my unwanted DSML experience, Best discussion was with Balaji (Today)

Overall Experience:
1) I have never felt that we are part of Advanced batch of DSML
2) It makes me feel that Advanced batch just misses out on basic topics
3) Looking for a solution to all these problems / switch of program

The additional features have been amazing :
1) AI - Interview
2) Mentor Sessions

Lastly Feedback on Payments Team (PropelID)
1) 5th of every month is Loan payment
2) 5th Jan was Sunday, payment failed from their end (I had enough balance in my account)
3) I had to make repayment on 10th (They were charging me late fee penalty which i fought)
4) I checked my Credit Score it show I missed Jan payment
5) CAN I do prepayment / OPT out from loan due to such inconveniences"
"Yes.
For every query we should approach support team and they do not come up with relevant responses.
What to do then??"
Why are you having this one to one chat to me personally? It a collective concern and should be resolved for everyone.
Please be definitive with a ETA here when you say “earliest”. Earliest can be a day , a week or a month. We do not have trust on you that is why asking you to please share the ETA. 🙏🏼
No.. they are not letting anyone out easily… they are unable to find replacements for my colleagues who left earlier
What the hell company bro is it ?
"Another exciting update from Scaler:

The coding test will be scheduled soon.
Getting this same mail for 15 days. maybe they’re training an AI to schedule it.
It’s like a regular pattern now.
And in 1-2 days, I’ll probably get another mail saying, 
The company has closed the application."
This is very disappointed i felt like I am trapped here
Initially mine was also loan processed as soon as I shared details with them without my approval or asking then later i proceed.
Same happened with me without consent it was approved i though they are taking for admission process and after loan thing they said you can try for 14 days after that you ask for refund
There are bunch of people from another batches also which was claiming about their fraud strategy
They are just making money and now loan collector will come behind us now i dont know what will be the solution because they are not listening
Everyone is stuck over here and we have only option is to pay up our money there is no support from the scaler and we get is they won’t refund
Yes so many post about their fraud and everything
They fooled us with their chikini chupdi baate and we stupid looking for hope got trapped into this
Yes I feel the same, there is no proper guidance how to prepare thay are not talking with any student once  joined, leaving like let them die
They will just delete your messages
Only concern scalar had was getting the fees

Yes for me as well also, this makes lostinng hopes and trust, we are spending lakhs of rupees and time

Though there was an improvement from first class, It felt so much disconnected, whatever he was teaching. There’s no smooth flow in the agenda, It may be only me but that’s what I felt.
"There is a disconnect in the style of delivery.
Not very engaging.

let see in the coming sessions if it improves!"
"My feedback is, definitely there is an improvement from previous class to yesterday's where his teaching style and interaction was a lot better. I was able to understand everything taught in class. 

But.. it didn't help me in solving assignments except 1 or 2 questions. I don't know where this gap is coming.  If the same continues in upcoming classes then it's a complete waste in attending classes rather we can prepare on our own."
"Even that 2 question was not properly discussed in a way that you can answer at one shot in assignment.

I watched the lecture again today. His teaching standard is way high for beginners."
"Another exciting update from Scaler:

Many people have addressed issues prior and if you have rectified those, this situation would not have come about. So just dig in the complaints and concerns you got from different students in the past couple of months and address those and stop this futile eyewashing exercise,
Don't to have professional plans very cheap quality
"Yesterday trainer said you join I will answer but now you are saying go some other place to get answer

You are playing games with us don't you have sence, very warest people you are unethical institution"
"Now you will not reply I know this is the Scaler rules and regulations you only collect money
For what ever fee you have taken there is no worthy no reply no solution you waste"
"Yesterday trainer said you join I will answer but now you are saying go some other place to get answer

You are playing games with us don't you have sence, very warest people you are unethical institution"
Don't to have professional plans very cheap quality
Maybe a timeline that is not vague will help us Students
In what's app reply you will take one day for call min 3 days need
"He is another mental person to take again the story
Waste Scaler"
No solution waste people
No solution waste people
"You can look at what you have promised to me at the moment of join

Did you read

If you like that will complain to consumer court

If are not good service mean then you are a waste only"
"I have given my feedback and it is as below,

When joining I was told that Data science is a new field and there is going to be less competition.

I was also told that scaler is admitting students only based on industry requirements. 

Clearly both the above are false, as the competition is fierce and industry requirement is nowhere near to the students at scaler."
I shared feedbacks and suggestions numerous times during the last 2 years and I am sick and tired of sharing feedbacks as Scaler simply doesn't care. Its a complete wastage of time. So not interested in sharing feedbacks any longer.
"Hello Everyone,

Shubham only today I just asked you few things you ignored and moved ahead I really felt very bad and if seeing the solutions is the purpose then I can go through the recorded lectures , I’m here to learn and to get the job , if I will not ful fill your requirement then simply I can’t the job and neither Scaler will help ,
I have asked to scaler team , these type of solution i can get with the help of tools Then what is the purpose of learning ,
After the course they will say the same thing when you ask for job ,
"Hi Shubham / Scaler Team,

I’d like to escalate an ongoing issue with the problem solving page. I’ve already raised this with the support team, but the problem remains unresolved even after multiple follow-ups.

A persistent pop-up keeps appearing no matter how many times I close it. It’s quite distracting and negatively impacts the overall user experience, especially since we spend hours working on this page.

The support team had mentioned they would get back to me, but it’s been over a month with no resolution. Please guide me on the proper escalation channel or next steps to ensure this issue is addressed promptly."
"I never received a ticket number or any concrete update — just a generic response after two weeks — and the issue still persists.

The recurring pop-up on the problem solving page continues to appear even after closing it multiple times. It’s a constant distraction and severely affects my problem-solving experience. Given how much time learners spend on this page, I’m sure you can understand the importance of a stable and clean interface.

It’s disappointing that such a simple, fixable issue has dragged on for weeks without any action or clarity. I don’t want another generic acknowledgment — please share the email/contact of the concerned escalation or product team so I can directly address this with them.

Appreciate your help in ensuring this is taken seriously and resolved soon."
"Not interested in 1:1 either… issues are simple and clear: not getting value as we paid for and as we were promised 
i.e 
1. good placement, 
2. advanced hands on projects

till now, in the name of data science only sql, stats, ML, the surface of deep learning is touched with toy examples…we want deep exposure to emerging gen AI technologies…because market is evolving very fast…
i have no word to explain the placement cell, can not compare to my college placement, because it do not even meet the basic standards…
maybe i am getting rejected or getting less eligible opennings because I did not got all certifications and scores right…but i would believe that it is good if any one I know from my batch got placed… that would  prove that it works and i should work harded…but i dont see any hope here…my resume is being rejected for all the jobs i applied in the portal…no way to know why so, when I scheduled meeting to discuss resume, the mentor said it is good enough + some basic tips i already learned from youtube…but not a single company noticed the resume

I would never expect any better if it were a cheap course from random site… but it costly, i could invest this amount of money somewhere better if I knew the actual side of scaler."
that is why need to stand out with cutting edge advantages…which I expected to achieve from scaler…
"Jokes apart, I think scaler must stop bringing in new batches and first focus on helping the existing batch students.

But instead it is making life harder for everyone by bringing in more aspirants"
grievances will stack up to become unbearable… then a new million dollar fraudstar will take up the headline
"Irony is -Scaler being in industry and not able to foresee “Gen ai and its impact in learning and job market” 


And we all are affected"
"Yes, my frustration is only because I was told scaler admits students based on industry requirement.

Specifically they said that they have request from organisations for so and so candidates and that's the reason hurrying to create talent by then.


And as for hard work, I have understood all that they have taught. I have explored the cloud platforms, created and hosted my own APIs. Built my own hyper parameter tuner which converges in a better way.


Basically, I lost both time and money because of the lie which scaler propagated. 

If not for the lie, I wouldn't have worked hard and given that much time. And of course I wouldn't have got myself into an EMI trap either."
I am talking about live module in case you not understood yet. The recorded modules are by an extremely poor instructor
"@919606003486 
I arranged the mentor session today and joined exactly on time, but the mentor didn’t even bother to show up. After waiting 30 minutes, someone from your team finally called just to say it’s cancelled"
Honestly, Scaler is acting like my time has no value  as if I’m here for free
Last time also sir took the session and I was not able to understand the concepts
It’s been months, and none of my concerns have been properly addressed. I’m really frustrated and disappointed with the level of service your team has been providing

A few months ago, your cofounder said he’d share the placement report within 3 months. Even today, when we ask about it, the only response we get is “we need more time.” It’s honestly shameless. How can we even expect companies to show up for placements under such mismanagement?

If your team doesn’t intend to provide proper service, then refund my money. Right now, dealing with you feels like a war
I feel that talking to customer service is completely useless. Connect me to someone from the top authority tomorrow
"In the AMA session held on 6th August 2025, none other than Anshuman committed that additional assignment questions will be added before 16th August 2025. Today is 14th October 2025.
In just about 2 days, we will complete 2 months

I have not checked, but am sure they have not been added.

Let me know if you want to bet something I surely can

One more comment and WhatsApp will be blocked"
"Hey Pankaj,

This was assured to us.
I hope Scaler keeps up the word.

Not sure about others, I had a connect with one your team member, he has assured the start of the course and module being added in my core curriculum. This didn't happen, yet."
FYI, I have given multiple bad NPS score, as my experience has not meet.
"Thanks for reaching out Pankaj,

I personally feel that there is nothing scaler can do to help me. But with that said, I would request you to add one more important concern. And that is to ensure the sales team of scaler don't bring in future candidates with false promises."

After months of my concerns not being addressed and my time being wasted, I have decided to withdraw from this course. I no longer wish to continue
I have already spoken to Arpita multiple times, and I feel that further discussions are unlikely to resolve my concerns. Therefore, I would like to withdraw from the course
"@918105882539 ,Does this means you will be asking for another two days again? Thanking us for our patience but not committing to your words is something very ironic here. Why there is no clarity even when you have committed for it 15 days back. Why it only becomes priority when you jump the timeline? This is not new, We all have seen this time and again. And a common practice in scaler when it comes to deliver to your committments. Disappointing AGAIN.

This time, I will not allow anyone from your team to influence my decision. Please contact Propelled and ensure they grant me the NOC. I will also not be making EMI payments from next month onwards

Guys totally unprofessional. Sad to say but this is norm now for you guys
Too much claim and so little action. Truly disappointed by scaler
@918105971511 Why have you removed a person who was asking valid questions
You need to apologise to me and other students for conning as and swindling our money.
i  ment don’t even return
Hey i have shared my views already that i am not interested but still i am getting calls from different people & also it's difficult to change to a separate program which is longer than a regular program
Write an open apology in social media tagging me making a commitment that you never again con students making fake claims and loot their money and stop your unethical practices henceforth I will consider if you could be excused.
Commit to ethical practices and preach positivity to others. The way you are going slowly the students community will get to know the scamsters you are.

"Hey Pankaj,

Take a deep breath and mend your ways. If you are not open to frank feedbacks about instructors even in internal forums and try to suppress basic concerns then students will be forced to share their experience in Social Media like so many have been writing in LinkedIn etc regarding how Scaler has conned them."
we paid your company lakhs of rupees and so we have the right to say content of a instructor poor if it do not aligns the quality we are expecting… isn’t it disrespectful from your side when u kick one of the learner from your platform out of group because he said the truth…

"@Pankaj,

Scaler has been claiming in the masterclasses that the placement rate for DSML students is 92% and the 8% who are not getting placed are the ones who are not interested in placement.

Also the highest package is above 1 Cr.

Dont you feel any shame conning students with false claims.

We have been requesting for a year now that if this is true please share the placement details with the students and also introduce us to the student who has got 1 Cr + package but due to obvious reasons there is pin drop silence on that.

It feels extremely bad to see new batch of students being conned that same way we have been conned.

Dont you have anything called conscience?"

"Saying an instructor is of poor quality is disrespectful? Did I make any personal comment about any specific instructor?

You want everyone to praise every instructor even if they do not find them good?"
"Let me perhaps rephrase or reiterate the common sentiment felt across.

During customer acquisition,  Scaler team makes a lot of claims like the below,

We are taking in students only because of industry requirements and by the time your course is done, you'll have openings in the market.

Data science is a new field and has less competition.

92% students are placed and the rest 8% are already working and don't need jobs.

I am very humbly requesting scaler team to not do that, for future batches at least. 

The fees we pay for scaler is not a small amount, and many pay that with obvious expectations. And when we don't get what we paid for, we feel cheated.

Please don't expect people to pay so much and then accept the company policies without question. 

Again, reiterating. Please have a thorough check on the promise the sales wing of scaler makes. This was both scaler and the future students are happy."

I have paid for this service. Stop treating me like I’m here for free. I expect my issues to be resolved immediately
"Here are my concerns 
1-The mentor didn’t join the session, and I wasn’t informed beforehand. I feel this shows total disrespect
2-I’ve been asking for the placement report repeatedly, and every time I’m told ‘we’ll get back to you next month,’ but it never happens
3-I requested a dedicated project building session and interview questions, yet I still haven’t received any update
4-No one from your team provides quick responses. I feel like I’m being taken for granted, as if I’m here for free"
I feel there has been no meaningful progress in my course, and I request a full refund. If that’s not possible, at least provide a 50% refund. If even that isn’t possible, instruct your team to communicate to Propelled that I have withdrawn, I will not be paying the EMI from next month, and they should grant me the NOC
it's been 3 days and did not get any response . please response as quick as possible. I am getting so frequently calls and whatsapps from  propelld .
We have requested multiple times and on email also
Hi, may I please know why did you remove that feature purposely? That was my source of motivation, I have also applied to a couple of companies and now I cannot see where my application is at currently due to the removal of that all jobs button. For last 6-7 months I could not see any companies due to the blockage of that feature and it was very depressing time for me, I worked hard and cleared the dsa coding round and that feature got unlocked and I got some motivation after that but its hardly been 1 month and again you have blocked that feature. Please bring it back as soon as possible.

"@918105882539 

Atleast take our vote into consideration because we are the one attending classes and even u know this will be Diwali festival week many of us won’t be able to attend classes then why to keep class on weekends??"
"Kindly avoid the weekend classes.In recent days we could able to see more rescheduling of classes.
Thats the reason we preferred the choice of weekday classes from the time of starting itself.
@918105882539 @919739601215"
Don’t keep on changing trainers it’s already a lot confusing with how classes are cancelled and rescheduling and happening on odd days at last moment.
We are not getting the value for the money we are paying
I am totally not satisfied with  the way scaler - what's going on.
"Atleast ask admins to respond here 

Don’t just sit duck and play around with everything"

@918105882539 Please don't change the instructors. It breaks the flow and understanding the concept gets difficult.
"In the AMA session held on 6th August 2025, none other than Anshuman committed that additional assignment questions will be added before 16th August 2025. Today is 14th October 2025.
In just about 2 days, we will complete 2 months

I have not checked, but am sure they have not been added.

Let me know if you want to bet something I surely can

One more comment and WhatsApp will be blocked"
Scaler will take us very lightly
Every they are doing same thing
They are frequently changing their instructor

never changed my batch
Yeah I also don't understand if we are getting the wrong emails why we have to reach out to support team to fix it
This is not acceptable we need to talk to scaler team , every class costs us huge. Everytime a new sync with new instructor not acceptable.
We are here not just to complete the course.. it's already delayed very much almost by one month. But if instructors are unavailable we can not have class just to complete the course
Yeah even every time they have different types of excuses.....
I can not continue the course with such negligence behaviour.
Even I fill the same they are giving not considerable excuses every time
We already waited so many days to start this module and again when last class feedback was good.Then what is the reason for instructor change
According to me, they should first send recordings of some good instructors as a demo, and then the best instructor should be allotted the class.
Very true, Hitesh. Scaler team, please don't waste our time. We have some hope after completing this course, and we are giving our valuable time to learn through this module. You keep postponing the classes and changing the instructor; that is not true.
I tried to call two numbers of Scaler admin here, no response. Anyone from management can please look into it?
Everyone knows importance of Linux in devops and what scaler is doing with us
To be honest, the DSA course I felt a bit fast compared to the Python basics. Although Piyush was a good instructor, I felt the DSA portion wasn’t covered in enough depth.
We don't want to waste our time
Actually, all of this is new for most of us. Some people might be familiar with it, but for others, it will be completely new. So, such steps are not good for us.
"These classes are not getting reflected on my dashboard, missed the previous session held on 11 Oct also. Already connected to scaler support but still issue is not fixed.

Kindly support 🙏"

"My feedback is, definitely there is an improvement from previous class to yesterday's where his teaching style and interaction was a lot better. I was able to understand everything taught in class. 

But.. it didn't help me in solving assignments except 1 or 2 questions. I don't know where this gap is coming.  If the same continues in upcoming classes then it's a complete waste in attending classes rather we can prepare on our own."
"Even that 2 question was not properly discussed in a way that you can answer at one shot in assignment.

I watched the lecture again today. His teaching standard is way high for beginners."
"These classes are not getting reflected on my dashboard, missed the previous session held on 11 Oct also. Already connected to scaler support but still issue is not fixed.

Didn't you think it was important to take our opinion at least once?
Every time someone new joins, we’re told that this one is the best instructor. If that’s the case, what about the previous ones? If they weren’t the best, then why were they teaching us in the first place? We’re here for the best learning experience, as you’ve mentioned — but if this keeps happening frequently, how are we supposed to adapt and properly understand each trainer’s approach?
Sorry to say @917897499665 but I am not happy with these type of things....or the way you are treating your folks...if you treat us like this ..Then why do you give admission to new or non-technical people?
I have a problem with the frequent changes not from the instructor
Why so ??? shall we came here for hit and trial ???
No one is came here for hit and trial
"Such type of reasoning is not acceptable at all. I am not sure who has given any wrong feedback for Vilas sir.. He was good.

What was need of changing instructor?"

According to me, we will have to stop speaking here because one person just comes, says whatever they feel like, and leaves. They don't respond to anything else we say. The Scalar team is so inactive and irresponsible.

"This is a funny excuse by Scaler team, if you are providing best instructor to us then why Rajat start this module from day 1, why did you choose some other instructor for us?
Scaler team, i hope you understand that what you are doing.
1. Changing modules content in between.
2. Changing instructors.
3. Delay or cancel the classes unnecessarily.
 Please understand we are the ones who will make scaler success or failure.
Rest upto you."
"@919606003486 @918105971511 

I really don't understand what's wrong with Scaler management, Vilas is very good trainer he has excellence in teaching the way he explains is unmatchable, On the very first day of vilas sir only there was some connectivity issue and he resolved it. 

We pay a huge amount just to get quality which vilas and piyush delivered.
Just bcoz of one day connectivity issue changing the instructor is completely beyond thought, 
The impact of changing trainer is really bad
We don't feel comfortable since there is no sync btwn us. 
There is huge communication gap. 
Delay in syllabus completion.  

And I belive no body is paying for such kind of hassle"
"Honestly we don’t care who teaches us because nothing is personal, but we need quality and i believe most of us found that quality in Vilas. I am certain feedback is not a problem because most of us who all are responding in the chat, are active in the class too. 
If you are certain on not bringing back Vilas then take a session with us to collect feedback about the instructor and take a poll next time before you switch the instructor."
I’m new to Linux and yeah I gave negative feedback. It’s my opinion and I don’t have to give reasons to anyone for it. Still, since people are asking, I’ll tell. I’ve seen demos from other online courses and honestly the teaching there was much better. Maybe for people who already know Linux a bit this course feels fine because they pick it up fast, but not everyone is like that. Some of us really struggled to follow his speed and the way he was explaining, that’s why we gave negative feedback. And obviously they don’t change an instructor just because of one person, I’m sure majority must have given negative, that’s why they replaced him. And please don’t say why I didn’t join the other course if it was so good, because I joined here thinking this will be even better, but clearly it’s not. I’ve seen other demos where just one real-time example was enough to understand everything, but here even after explaining multiple times it still didn’t click.
"This is same for me.. even in other 2 module also . They just taught the things one who already know the concept. Not for the fresher or one who not in IT field ..  

We spent lakh together here to get best of it.. but nothing seems to be good here.. 

Sorry to say this.. 

And also we are getting call for updating to next version of course . Not for not doing any assignments or absenting classes. 

Think about this , if all this team gave -ve feedback in publicly what happens to Scaler image?

Need one proper solution for this..!!

 But for this module I am voting for Vilas sir..!!!"

We are already paying a considerable fee, and when I enrolled, I was informed that the syllabus would be tailored to meet industry requirements and that all such updates would be covered within the existing course fee, without any additional charges. Considering the high cost, I found that approach reassuring. However, it is surprising now to hear a different message. That said, I understand it would ultimately be our choice whether to opt for it or not.
I left the class after 15-20 minutes. Because of the same.
its not about the only Instructor but they are changing operational way like level of assignments , lack of roadmap  , no quiz between class to know what we are understanding out of whatever getting taught . making class very less interactive

Just bcoz of one day connectivity issue changing the instructor is completely beyond thought, 
The impact of changing trainer is really bad
We don't feel comfortable since there is no sync btwn us. 
There is huge communication gap. 
Delay in syllabus completion.  

And I belive no body is paying for such kind of hassle"
"This is same for me.. even in other 2 module also . They just taught the things one who already know the concept. Not for the fresher or one who not in IT field ..  

We spent lakh together here to get best of it.. but nothing seems to be good here.. 

Sorry to say this.. 

And also we are getting call for updating to next version of course . Not for not doing any assignments or absenting classes. 

Think about this , if all this team gave -ve feedback in publicly what happens to Scaler image?

Need one proper solution for this..!!

 But for this module I am voting for Vilas sir..!!!"
"This is a funny excuse by Scaler team, if you are providing best instructor to us then why Rajat start this module from day 1, why did you choose some other instructor for us?
Scaler team, i hope you understand that what you are doing.
1. Changing modules content in between.
2. Changing instructors.
3. Delay or cancel the classes unnecessarily.
 Please understand we are the ones who will make scaler success or failure.
Rest upto you."
its not about the only Instructor but they are changing operational way like level of assignments , lack of roadmap  , no quiz between class to know what we are understanding out of whatever getting taught . making class very less interactive
I’m new to Linux and yeah I gave negative feedback. It’s my opinion and I don’t have to give reasons to anyone for it. Still, since people are asking, I’ll tell. I’ve seen demos from other online courses and honestly the teaching there was much better. Maybe for people who already know Linux a bit this course feels fine because they pick it up fast, but not everyone is like that. Some of us really struggled to follow his speed and the way he was explaining, that’s why we gave negative feedback. And obviously they don’t change an instructor just because of one person, I’m sure majority must have given negative, that’s why they replaced him. And please don’t say why I didn’t join the other course if it was so good, because I joined here thinking this will be even better, but clearly it’s not. I’ve seen other demos where just one real-time example was enough to understand everything, but here even after explaining multiple times it still didn’t click.
For Linux module no class roadmap / syllabus shared in nonfiction email. It really help us to get ready for class in a better way. Scaler team please look into it.
Kindly stand your words this time and do not us chase you again. We should be spending time in learning rather than chasing you.
"It was clearly mentioned that 3 OCT class has been cancelled and scheduled to 1 st oct
This is creating a lot of confusion"
Man scaler response is very slow specially in the case of technical issue I have cleared my interview and it is not reflecting even after 9 hrs and the support guy called me that may be you did non proctor mode
@918105882539 any idea why wrong communication happening over mails
The companion is not letting us connect to the scalar support team
If you can't help us atleast forward our situation to your support team
We already waited so many days to start this module and again when last class feedback was good.Then what is the reason for instructor change
FYI, I have given multiple bad NPS score, as my experience has not meet.
I feel there has been no meaningful progress in my course, and I request a full refund. If that’s not possible, at least provide a 50% refund. If even that isn’t possible, instruct your team to communicate to Propelled that I have withdrawn, I will not be paying the EMI from next month, and they should grant me the NOC
A few days ago, I spoke with Gaurav, and he told me that you have my number and can contact me anytime. Yet, he doesn’t even bother to reply
It’s been over 2 hours and I still haven’t received a call back
It’s clear by now that you’re not going to help me with placements
Placement isn’t my only concern there are several other issues, and your team has consistently failed to address them I’m exhausted from repeatedly raising the same problems
I already listed all my concerns yesterday, and I cannot keep repeating the same issues
Refund is not feasible post trial period ends.
Since last four months ur team has been saying the same thing
I'm not asking for a guaranteed placement, I'm asking for an assurance there's a clear difference
I already emailed them the day before yesterday, and I haven’t received a reply yet
How long am I supposed to wait? I’ve paid for this service stop acting as if I’m here for free

"If it were the first time, I would have definitely agreed with you. But things have been a complete mess ever since the DevOps module began.
I’m a fresher who graduated just three months ago, and honestly, this course hasn’t helped me in any way. The instructors, TAs, and assignments have all been disappointing"
Even regarding the mentor session that was supposed to happen the day before yesterday — your team didn’t bother to inform or update me that the mentor wasn’t available
I’m honestly fed up with the kind of support your team has been providing. I’ve completely lost hope of getting a job, and my interest in studying is fading day by day
"Right now, I’m currently without a job and had requested Arpita to help me secure a DevOps or Cloud internship opportunity. I also assured her that I’m fully ready to attend any interviews or complete any necessary tests for that internship.
However, I haven’t received any updates regarding this"
I don’t find the current instructor beginner-friendly, and I’m struggling to keep up with the assignments
It feels like there’s no personal support or attention for me, despite having paid ₹3 lakhs for this course
There are no dedicated sessions on project building or solving interview questions. How are we expected to crack a DevOps job under these circumstances?
I believe it will take another 5–6 months for our batch to complete all the necessary modules. Even after that, I’m not confident that companies will actually show up for placements
Yes, I’ve already shared my feedback about the instructor with my RM and your customer support team, but I feel it’s still the same
after paying ₹3 lakhs, this should feel like a valuable learning experience. Instead, it feels like a constant struggle
On August 6, we had an AMA session with your cofounder, during which he made several promises and assured us of a top-level learning experience. However, it’s been over two months, and it feels like those promises have not been fulfilled
And it’s not just me most learners in our batch feel the same

Do u even care to reply ??
It’s been communicated multiple times to the @918105971511 even before starting the Tableau Module which is around two months back, so there is no scope remain that the  @918105971511 was not aware of it.
@918105971511 we requested you two months before to assign Mr.Saurabh
I’m not here for free and I expect things to get done in time
I am not getting it why the @918105882539 is not supportive enough for in case of student concerns. Do you then really this we would recommend our family and friends to join Scaler with suck kind of support???
Kindly stand your words this time and do not us chase you again. We should be spending time in learning rather than chasing you.
I am particularly sure this won't get resolved today and we still be standing on same lane where we were weeks ago
Now to unlock career hub suddenly we have to clear 3 mock and 3 contest
If the product was not complete. Why you enrolled us
On the peak time. Inke ab mock clear karo jo itne tough denge hoga hi nahi kisi se
This group does not have accountable people except one or two admins to answer actually, there is no point raising or ranting over here,
You want us to wait till the module start and then it will be late
escalations is one more way,  write mail to escalations, not sure if the feedbacks taken there are actually been considered.
@918105971511 @918105882539 Your team is making it really complicated and not at all understanding student’s concerns, in this case I will past the entire concern to my LinkedIn page tagging Scaler and Anshuman sir, so  everyone should know how scaler team take students issues….
It’s really enough now @918105971511 @918105882539 we have informed two months back our concern about assigning the instructor and your team still have not addressed it, it clearly shows how well you take care of students issues.

@918105971511 @918105882539 I have well informed to the support team in detail via Souvik Chaudhary of your team. We have done all our part from our side, informed multiple times so nothing is pending now there is nothing further remains to provide, now everything is at yours team hand
It’s also taking lot of our time so please address this asap
@918105971511 @918105882539 We are here to study not to engage with such issues and waste our time. Ideally this must have been addressed well in advance from your side only

I will mention all these to my all social media pages so that l students should know how Scaler Support Team treats students
You can not remove me just because I am raising concerns
It’s really unfair to me, you cannot do this, once all the people at my LinkedIn page get to know this then it will be not good for Scaler, I have thousands of followers, they will get to know how u treating students who raising concerns

I spoke with Shubham, and he mentioned that he would connect me with the refund team. However, it’s been an hour, and he has not responded to my calls or messages
Kindly connect me to the senior  management member of the refund team
"@918105971511 & @918105882539 
I wanted to understand why that person was removed. He had already enrolled in the course, and as a participant, he has the right to ask questions or make requests related to the course. Just like the rest of us, if a request cannot be fulfilled, you can simply inform us that it’s a management decision and nothing can be done.

However, removing someone doesn’t seem like the right approach. I personally feel that this could happen to anyone — for instance, if I post something tomorrow, I could also be removed. You mentioned it was due to spamming, but in this case, we were genuinely asking questions and not receiving proper responses. If someone posts something unrelated to the course, that could be considered spamming, but this situation seems different.

So, I believe removing that person was not a fair decision."
These topics were available over the you tube for free we have paid to learn from the experts who matches our learning phase
Scaler support isn't helping us on this matter. Everyone wants to stay in the adaptive batch itself and not be forced to move to regular batches that's why we have raised concern with the instructor.

Scaler support isn't helping us on this matter. Everyone wants to stay in the adaptive batch itself and not be forced to move to regular batches that's why we have raised concern with the instructor.
True, they could have informed us earlier that since Tuesday's class is cancelled, it is rescheduled to Thursday, rather than scheduling it at the last moment. Personal schedule gets disturbed by this last moment schedule
"If the plan is to transition us temporarily, just to complete the missed modules (like SQL, DA profiling, etc.)—that’s completely understandable. However, if the intention is to keep us in the Regular Batch permanently, that would be a point of concern.

Most of us had specifically opted for the Adaptive Batch because we were unable to keep up with the pace of the regular sessions. During our reset, we were clearly informed that it would be our choice whether to continue in the Adaptive Batch or move to the Regular Batch, and that Scaler would not enforce the switch.

Right now, the communication and approach seem to be the opposite of what was initially agreed upon, which is why I wanted to highlight this for clarity and escalation if necessary.

Even in the non proctored mode there is no code editor. The AI asks us to write the code but there is nothing.

The system is rejecting and you do not qualify for LLD. Is this not enough reason. The system that let's you qualify for job eligibility is giving reject without even mistake of yours and based on coding test that is not enabled in the system and you are fine with it. Such attitudes inculcate sense of chalta hai and gets spread everywhere. The platform and the system should have the basic minimum standard of how it needs to work. Saying oh that's just one functionality that is not working makes sense if it is not a critical functionality of the module. Here it is critical because it is rejecting even if you give all right answers. Do not trifle when time and efforts of participants are getting wasted. You may give good feedback to Scaler but do not make light of matters here.
They might be mistakenly added into this question,apart from this nearly all questions have issue or half explanation
"@918105971511 I just wanted to share that I’m really struggling with the Linux module. The assignments feel quite tough and don’t seem related to what was covered in the classes so far. Since I’m new to Linux, it’s becoming difficult to complete the tasks without looking for help outside.
In the earlier modules, the sessions were structured in a way that if we attended the class properly, we could easily complete the assignments. But in this Linux module, that’s not happening — and the class pace also seems to be lagging behind the assignment topics.
Honestly, it’s a bit demotivating, and I’m feeling frustrated after the first few classes. Hoping the upcoming sessions can focus more on the topics needed for the assignments or maybe provide some extra guidance."
Hi @918105971511 @918105882539 we are awaiting you update on this since Thursday. If this is not confirmed, how far it's fair to finish all the things on time?

"@918105882539 , I have tried the mock interview of LLD part 1 and I see a lot of issues in the interview:

1) it asks to write the code, but there is no code editor ( we are not allowed to open any other tab), and provide the feedback saying we are not able to write the code, or we avoided coding the examples and lacks the skill for coding.

2) It asks a question and without us finishing the answer, it automatically goes to next question and in feedback it mentions that we are unable to answer the question.

3) It asks the internals of JVM and the In-depth knowledge of Garbage collection that is not covered as a part of the class, (@917010529344 , may be you can give us some documents that will help us in getting the in-depth knowledge of the garbage collections). @918105882539  can you please make sure we have classes on the topics that are critical for the mock / real interviews.

4) it asks questions on SOLID principles that are not yet covered and will be covered in the next module"
@918105882539 please let us know when all these issues are resolved. All such issues waste time. Please build a platform that has basic useability not one which wastes and frustrates participants.

to be honest it is pain to attend continuous classes . even though you can say HLD is optional Class .
You guys not perfect. Else then faulty system n ridiculous system. I don't understand why naman and Ayushman had not took any credits even after taking all the money. Why we keep having new things upcoming with just problem. Schedule a ama . As we need a clarification not some useless updates

We also do not like raising concerns here. But when nobody is listening to us even when the whole batch wants the same things, then we have to make you hear us collectively, this space is the only place where everyone can voice their concerns together. Sorry but not sorry.

You guys are also involved in this fraud. Your policy is that anything discussion should be with proof. But still you allow them to call from personal number or over whatsapp call. And after that you guys check for the recordings in which they don’t give promise. But for false promises you guys let them call from personal numbers and whatsapp call. Even after sharing you the screenshots of whatsapp calls she made, the personal number she called from and no actions has taken against her. I am filling a case against scaler as the main culprit is scaler itself as I can see from your behaviour. This is totally unacceptable and I will publicly recommend everyone who are planning to go for scaler. As you guys don’t care about students. Whatever you care about is only money. Attract people with false promises for high price course which even are not worth 25% the price you are taking. You guys just attract people and for this you allow your professionals to call from personal number and whatapp number for false promises so that no proof should be there. I am filling case against all those who are involved in this matter and taking no actions against the proofs that I shared.
"HI @918105971511 
Kindly provide the available instructors for the python module 1 because as the sudden instance appended but we also need to pay the monthly EMI right. In order to wait from 14th oct 2025 to 27 oct 2025.
kindly take any decisions which will help all the learner"
Yeah, I think the problem's on the scaler's end.
@919606003486  assignment have many miss-match and unclear issue
Unclear explanations
Anyone noticed this issue. The problem statement clearly mentions that ties needs to be included but it’s expected output is incorrect. Their own solution which they have added is not working.
Yes I feel most of the questions/topics are not covered in the class. Tough trying to solve with help.
If the topics are not covered you can’t do anything
I have asked to support team, they are saying no instructor/batch having maths for ml starts earlier. So you have to wait for month.
Ok….this excuse doesn’t feel right from scaler side.….
If they keep giving a month's gap between modules, this course will take forever to end.
Dear scaler team also pause my emi and pay me months of extra salary which I may have got if these unplanned pauses will happen
We paid for manga not the fillers

I friends, I am srinivas reddy- I am just sharing, my experience with scaler-,I was worked as a assistant manager in Govt bank, I want to shift my career from banking to business or other field. At that time scaler team has called me and assured me that scaler has a good placement cell, many people changed from non-IT to IT. And I am in domain of banking they have informed me that,- data analysis and data science will be good choice. they have called me daily 4 to 5 times a day and convience me to take this course. At starting 10 days itself, I want to cancel the course but they have informed me that I will get openings from companies after 3 months itself( Shared the screen shots) and I have talked with mentor also, he informed me that it a wise decision. So I have taken the course and started preparing- after 4 months I talked with the relationship manager kanika and  ameira, the person who has joined me, they have informed me that after eda and sql mock interview and module test, companies will be open for me. I have completed the module test and mock interview again I have called them and this time  they have informed me that after product analytics, companies will come and you can get placed. Now the same people saying , market is not good and companies are not looking for freshers and wait for some more time. Now I was hope less and asked for cancellation, so that atleast I don't need to pay the amount, which is not giving a fruitfull result for me. The mentor who was told me that he will help me in projects, resume building and in career, is left from scaler, when I told the same thing to relationship manager she suggested me other mentors, now the new mentors are telling me that for a non IT to IT changing person , it is diffult to get the job. And when I talk with ameria, now she was not even responding properly. So I have told the complete story to support team and they have given suggestion that my resume is not proper, they have changed the resume and after seeing  the resume (they have changed), I have understand how grantedly they have taken us. They have pepared the resume like I have experience in data analyst, and using python everything in my old organization, where I haven't worked as a data analyst. Now I was fully hopeless and I raised mail to refund team, and told complete my story, now they were telling they will not cancel the course after 14 days, I just want to know if they don't cancel course, why they were giving false promises that companies will come after 3 to 4 months and after that mentors, relationship mangers not even responding properly. I have also applied for intern also, but they were rejecting the application , but they haven't mentioned the reasons.I know that many people are like me with Non-IT background and hoping scaler will help to get companies.  I am sharing my chat history while I want to cancel the course at starting 10 days and how they have convinced me stating that openings will come after 3-4 months and also share the resume they have prepared, stating that I have worked as data analyst in my old organization, which I haven't worked. Now I have raised complain to support team, they have assured me that they make audit on this thing and they will take action against people who has given false promises and malpractice for joining the course. If you people are also facing same issue or want to raise complaint on people giving false promises , kindly raise complaint to support team  or refund team and they will do audit on peoples who are doing malpractice and false promises. As I was suffered with scaler team, I don't want to suffer any person like this.  Now I was hopeless and frustrated on scaler and they false hopes. Since ,As I can't able to talk with higher authorities ,If you think it will help our students and people in this group, kindly share to othergroups and higher authorise , so that top management also understand what is happening at ground level. If you can help me, I want to make it big thing and make sure that scaler people will not do these false promises and malpractices.

we have contacted support team and refund team also, there is no proper response sir.
Yes madam, i know that market is not good and i am also practical person. i haven't event got calls for interviews and even i have applied all are rejected the applications, if the scaler is not stand on the words they have told, then atleast they can cancel the course right? not for refund atleast they can stop deducting the emi for future months right? everything why we are getting convienced by them? even mistake is on there side. and most importantly, i have asked them to cancel the course in tha starting 10 days of my course, they haven't done and convienced me to take course. now i am jobless. Because of the false promises, malpractices done my scaler sales team, why we have to suffer? i just want to make sure that the top management of scaler team should take action against them.

I agreed. I shared about the job market experience I had and the misconveying things that within 3 months placement will be open. Because I heard same from some other batchmates in community group.
thankyou, if you feel this is true, kindly share to other groups, so that atleast , the people with same issue can make a voice against  the scaler

I had few openings in my company and posted in few of the group but few people criticized saying that we have spent this much amount and shouldn't fall for the job with less packages, so i have stopped sharing the details in scaler groups.

Please ask your support team or whichever team to help us getting our resume shortlisted, rest is on us. Talk to companies from your end and help in that. We thought that u have some tie ups with the companies but it doesn't seems the same way.

No call backs from your team
I still have some concerns because I was shortlisted for an interview 12 days ago but haven't received any further updates regarding the upcoming process
And I also tried contacting the member whose details was provided in my mail but he didn't even reply
I also see no job roles have been posted in last 30 days
Yes sir, we have understand that but if everyone share there problems in a single group what is the issue? You people can consolidate the problems and make a course of action right? Or am I wrong? Kindly suggest me. And till now I haven't received any call back
"It does not negatively post to impact to the group sir

It's the truth we are saying 
Investment lakhs at the end 
we are not getting proper guidance, support and placement"
"So, I request scaler 
To place us in the good organization 
As you promised us at time of joining the course"

i saw this, it's good...but what is not good!! saying things which are not even the part of the process,like "getting interviews, gap years are not problems for us because we have tie ups with companies, students just need to do their skills enhancement work" these things were said right for us to not doubt Scaler's processes, But the reality is totally different  .... SO calling spade a spade is neccessary with all due respect, and we should not ignore negativity..we should see through it in order to rectify it. We are being respectfully true in our cases, and we expect more than just "good words" to start our career. Individuals like me were thinking it's jsut them who are going through all this. I am not happy to see how Scaler is managing the problems, but i am happy to resonante with my  batchmates in the same problem.
Sir , if we are doing separately in mails they were not responding properly, so we are all together want the solution. If you want we all people come to your office and ask the same thing

#ERROR!
"@918105971511 99% or even I can say 100% learners are here for placement only as this was promised to us at the starting of the course. We paid 3 lacs for placement offers not solely for lectures and assignment. I don't wanna be rude at all but we can learn all these things from outside source like youtube. Content is unlimited on YouTube. Although for me the learning experience so far so good in scaler. But at the end, if we didn't get placed there is no point of all these knowledge we have. 
And can you give us a solution for this. Like do we just need to send mails to the respective teams or is there anything else that you or us can do for this major issue. ? Mail part I think some of the learners have already done."
"Most of us are in scaler now from Dec-24 … All basic skills and learnings are done now. 

Data science and AI are very advanced things, most of us are here to transitioned career in data field. 

When we will get this transitioned thing done ? It was promised by scaler team"
Right, but collectivism is important, individual actions towards the same issue was not worked upon before,  i am sorry you are not able to manage it, but the thing is.. If Scaler was doing things in right manner, all this situation would have never occured, so individually talking to customer support team and relationship manager, is practically doing nothing. These are words "owning" etc, i am sorry but i need to say it outloud, owing means doing everything in response to what went wrong. But Instead, there is nothing but flowery language in the end. The thing is, getting interviews is really necessarry. What we are expecting is still far below what was promised. I would like you to not try keep this group only for studies, referrals..The end goal was placement, shoudnt we discuss upon it? Market might be tough, patience is fine..But rejections of resume even for internships od 20k 10k, is something i don't understand
I agree with my batchmates, we have a valid point here. And just in case, if there is no resolution through the mail, what action should a learner take. Many of us here have taken loans at 50% (ie 1.5lks extra) for this course. Just on the words of the sales team assurance, that the pay after 6 months will be enough for us to pay back the full loan in 6 months. Many of us have put our lives on the line to transition from non-tech to DS jobs.
infact the salesperson told me, our calls are being recorded we can't lie, that was a lie itself 😅.............. i think this group is meant to solve problems, there is no bigger problem than placemnet issues. My healthier batchmates who do not resonate with this topic are lucky, and i congratulate them that they should not face all these things, but i hope even they understand it's a real problem for some of us.
I totally agreed with u all I am from non IT background and joined scaler to get good job in IT. Also left my previous job just to focus on this course so that I can get good outcome and so far I haven’t even get any internship from scaler but iam paying monthly instalments on time 😅.
Sukanya  the thing is right and correct, i think everyone is doing their bid to get rid of this situation,and your solution is apprecaible. But Scaler is responsible, i just hope the topic doesnt deviate or dilute the problem without solutions from Scalerr.
all these things, were not told before.. it's just they should be better accountable.
Idk why they are unware of pipelines
"And what they didnt clearly tell before is...."" after we started applying we got to know"" the inefficiencies of Scaler, upon which they are enrolling people like us who have year gaps.
See you and other people who have unskilled themselves equally, are not different.the only difference is...of ""past"" which is the greatest factor in rejection of resumes..but few are provided with good opportunities even with same skill set(I understand this is how market works) 
But everyone who is eligible should be provided the opportunity to be sitting in interviews...thats the purpose of this discussions..."
"Yeah I get it, Actually I was talking about...there is a difference between: before one enters into carrershub portal ( what scaler's make us believe) and after joining carter's hub everything is crystal clear.....
These discrepancies were not made clear before..anyways now my focus is to have some good rectifications on it"
I also see no job roles have been posted in last 30 days

python notebook to pdf directly is even worse.
Can  anyone give me suggestions, how we can fight against these scaler teams , so that we can implement it
@918105882539 Just my humble request as it was the festive time for diwali and you guys has given off time. It was seen that at the same time you have kept the module test also and given business case study as well. How can it be possible to meet the deadline for these. Please don’t keep these assignments during festive duration.
"@918105882539 @919606003486 @918529732105  please, this is repeated request to give detailed agenda of the topic in the reminder email. 
Also instead of 2 reminder on the same  day scaler team can set clock one day before, so that if anyone want to explore topic on their own, they can."
"We also do not like raising concerns here. But when nobody is listening to us even when the whole batch wants the same things, then we have to make you hear us collectively, this space is the only place where everyone can voice their concerns together. Sorry but not sorry.
And this is not happening for the 1st time. Faced same issue when I was in different batch. Scaler support didn't help at all, only when whole batch came together they listened"
@917077100358 can you please check as we aren't getting any positive response from scaler support
@918105971511 My Tableau module is still pending, but there is no update about it on the dashboard. Instead, there is an update about the DA portfolio module which is going to start from 28th October and will continue till 13th November. According to the message posted by Per Scaler here, the classes of those whose Tableau is pending will start from 3rd November. What kind of confusion is this?
"@918105971511 
Before joining the adaptive batch they said it will be our choice to continue or shift to a regular batch, that's why I wasted 3-4 months took reset. Now you are forcing me to a regular batch bcos you guys put people from different incompleted modules together and now separating. Different adpt batch are running smoothly without this issue. 

This is your mismanagement. Even after paying 3L you guys can't provide us with proper job opportunities at least give us the schedule we need to learn in our own pace. 

Hi @917897499665  this is how your company is treating your costumers, 0 costumer satisfaction."
"❗Please escalate it asap, I NEED TO TALK TO THE UPPER MANAGEMENT MYSELF, shedule a meeting on Monday. I am done with the incapable scaler support ❗

few questions asked in contest have not been taught in class
I requested a call back but haven't received any
"@918105971511, @919267924464,
Another dataset missing:
I noticed that the dataset churn.csv is missing from the Naive Bayes lecture (28 July 2025). Could you please help me get access to this file?
I’ve been facing repeated issues with missing datasets across multiple lectures. The support team has been directing me here, but the resolution process is taking quite a long time and it’s affecting my learning progress.
I would really appreciate it if this issue could be resolved quickly or if a permanent solution could be implemented for such missing files."
issue yet not resolved.
I asked one TA if he could evaluate my work if i would share my google colab notebook with him, he didn't even care to respond.

The business case evaluations are very bad. I don't think the evaluators are doing a good job on evaluating and they're basically scoring randomly.

One of the feedbacks I got was:
Multiple models were built including Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest with appropriate evaluation metrics (R, MAE, MSE, RMSE). The model comparison was clear, though feature selection could have been more methodically justified.

We've studied till Linear Regression. The business case is for Linear Regression.
I've not done any Decision Tree/Random Forest model evaluations.  

Anyone else felt the same?"
"I feel very bad about this. 
I spent a lot of time on this for some random feedback."
Evaluators on my case didn't even grade my answers to Q8 and Q9.They graded until Q7.
